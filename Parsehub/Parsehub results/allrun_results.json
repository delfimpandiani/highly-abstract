     "text": "The central rotund shape in this painting derives from a photograph of a Sudanese corn-bin, which Ernst has transformed into a sinister mechanical monster. Ernst often re-used found images, and either added or removed elements in order to create new realities, all the more disturbing for being drawn from the known world. The work’s title comes from a childish German rhyme that begins: ‘The elephant from Celebes has sticky, yellow bottom grease’. The painting’s inexplicable combinations, such as the headless female figure and the elephant-like creature, suggest images from a dream and the Freudian technique of free association."

     "text": "'Celebes', or 'The Elephant Celebes' as it is sometimes known, was painted in Cologne in 1921 and was Max Ernst's first large picture. It was bought shortly after its completion by his friend the poet Paul Eluard and later passed from him to Sir Roland Penrose, who owned it until 1975 when he gave it to be sold for the benefit of the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Sir Roland's Charlton Lecture, op. cit., is by far the most detailed study of it and is the basis of the following note. The reader is referred to it for a detailed compositional analysis and interpretation."

     "text": "The boiler-like monster to which the title refers is, like the rest of the painting, highly ambiguous. It has a horned head with apparently sightless eyes, but a pair of tusks projecting on the left suggests the possible presence of a second head (or perhaps the real head?) on the other side. Its neck seems to consist of a long snake-like coil which emerges from a hole in its upper section; the top is surmounted by a brightly-coloured construction containing a mysterious eye. It seems to be standing in a large open space, but there are also indications that it is embedded in a solid background, while two fishes swim in the sky above. Three upright objects stand around it, while in the bottom corner a headless mannequin figure with a raised arm appears to be beckoning the monster towards it."

     "text": "As was first noted by John Craxton and subsequently confirmed by Ernst himself, the image of the boiler-like form on its pair of 'legs' was originally inspired by an illustration in an English anthropological journal of a huge communal corn-bin peculiar to the Konkombwa tribe of the southern Sudan. The photograph is taken from the same angle and is basically very similar, but the artist has given the hollow clay container a metallic appearance and changed its character completely by adding the various appendages described above."

     "text": "Bear (10 minutes, 35 seconds) was Steve McQueen's first major film. Although not an overtly political work, for many viewers it raises sensitive issues about race, homoeroticism and violence. It depicts two naked men-one of whom is the artist-tussling and teasing one another in an encounter which shifts between tenderness and aggression. The film is silent but a series of stares, glances and winks between the protagonists creates an optical language of flirtation and threat."
    },
    {
     "text": "In defiance of cinematic convention, the film opens with a close-up shot of one man's shoulder. The camera then moves slowly upwards and to the right, traversing his face with a proximity that suggests it is almost feeling its way across the contours of his skin. After less than a minute, the slow rhythm of this opening shot is interrupted by a dynamic scene of sparring between the two men. Throughout the film, the disorientating camerawork and silent movement of the two bodies moving across a shaft of light, adds to the existing sense of ambiguity. Light sometimes dances off the reflective sweat on their skin, sometimes throws them into shadow and sometimes momentarily blinds the viewer when its full glare is uninterrupted. At certain moments, close-up shots from underneath the men's two interlocked bodies tend towards abstraction with swinging genitalia the only markers for orientation amid a confusion of limbs. Near the end of the film, a back-edited sequence of feet circling around the camera, taunting and dodging each another, recalls the fragmented movement of Eadweard Muybridge's nineteenth century locomotion photographs. This scene can be particularly related to the interest in early cinema which has informed much of McQueen's work."
    },
    {
     "text": "Like all McQueen's early films, Bear is black and white. It was shot on 16mm film but has been transferred to video and is installed floor to ceiling across one wall in a black room. The floor of this room is highly polished so that a reflection of the image falls across it and the viewer is unable to stand outside its presence. McQueen's strategy of displaying the work in an enclosed space and on a scale above human proportions has important implications: 'You are very much involved in what's going on. You are a participant not a passive viewer,' he has explained (Bickers, p.2). In addition, the silence of Bear is intended to be disconcerting: 'The whole idea of making it a silent piece is so that when people walk into the space they become very much aware of themselves, of their own breathing,' McQueen has commented. 'I want to put people into a situation where they're sensitive to themselves watching the piece' (Bickers, p.2)."

The startlingly violent image of three interlocking figures was derived from a lost work by the Mexican painter José Clemente Orozco showing the fraternal struggle between Cain and Abel. Pollock’s exploration of the theme may reflect his interest in the archetypal myths explored in Jungian psychoanalysis. The subject may also refer to the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War, which engulfed Europe as America looked on with horror."

Its composition appears to show three naked male figures: the man on the right is attempting to strike the others with a knife and is being fought off by the man in the centre, while the third man on the left is crouching in terror, with his arms raised in protection. The forms are closely packed and interlocking, with violent, angular clashes of movement, and dramatic contrasts of light and shade.\nIn his article in Artforum, O'Connor stresses the influence of Orozco on Pollock's work at this period and suggests that this picture (as well as showing Orozco's stylistic influence) utilizes figure motifs borrowed from Orozco's frescoes at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, painted in 1932–4. The similarity seems to be mainly between the two left-hand figures and several of the figures on the left of Orozco's panel ‘The Departure of Quetzalcoatl’, though the resemblance is not close enough to be conclusive. The fact that there is little or no sign of the influence of Picasso and Miró, whose influence began to displace Orozco's from 1940–41 onwards, would suggest that its date can probably be narrowed down to the period 1938–40.\nWhereas Orozco's paintings have dramatic subjects based on historical or mythological events, the drama in this picture by Pollock seems to be purely subjective in origin.\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1980-82: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1984"

    {
     "text": "Sabra and Shatila Massacre 1982–3 is a monumental work in ball point pen and pencil on paper, constructed in six sections and affixed to canvas for support. The work was made in response to the massacre by Christian Lebanese Phalangists of Palestinian refugees in the camps in Beirut, Lebanon, between 16 and 18 September 1982, while the camps were under the guard of the Israeli Defence Force. Working from imagination, al-Azzawi has delineated the scenes of chaos and horror in the Sabra and Shatila camps in a semi-abstract style, with a shallow perspective."
    },
    {
     "text": "Speaking with Tate curator Jessica Morgan on 27 April 2011, the artist explained that his decision to depict the scenes of the massacre was inspired by reading the essay Quatre Heures à Chatila (Four Hours in Shatila) by French writer Jean Genet (1910–1986). Genet was in Beirut when the massacres took place and was one of the first observers to enter the camps thereafter. He wrote: ‘A photograph doesn’t show the flies nor the thick white smell of death. Neither does it show how you must jump over the bodies as you walk along from one corpse to the next … A barbaric party had taken place there.’ (Jean Genet, ‘Quatre heures à Chatila’, Revue d’études palestiniennes, vol.6, Winter 1983, pp.3–19.) Al-Azzawi explained that the drawing was made in his home in Highgate, London, over a number of months, during which time he worked solely on this project. Stylistically it owes a debt to Pablo Picasso’s Guernica 1937 (Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid), although al-Azzawi’s drawing is considerably more claustrophobic; the vast expanse of paper offers no respite from the horror of the scene, being densely packed with body parts, architectural and domestic details, images of animals and bombs."
    },
    {
     "text": "Markedly different to al-Azzawi’s normally colourful paintings and relief sculptures from this time, the use of mainly black and grey tones in Sabra and Shatila Massacre is interrupted by moments of colour used to depict the earthy tones of the ground or the red of blood. This restrained use of colour makes its appearance all the more jarring in the massive expanse of the drawing. The style of this work relates more closely to the print and book illustrations by the artist, practices that have consistently been major parts of his output. In 1976 al-Azzawi made a series of drawings for a book about the destruction and loss of life at the Tel al-Zaatar Palestinian refugee camp in that year, similarly calling on literature to mediate the violence of the event. On his use of literature, and in particular poetry, as a catalyst for his work al-Azzawi has said: ‘The poem is very important. It gives the artist a great deal in terms of atmosphere. I wanted to paint the tragedy of Tel al-Zaatar. I started, but later I turned to the poems, they gave me the inspiration I needed.’ (Quoted in http://www.azzawiart.com/essays_by_dia.php?id=4, accessed 1 August 2011.) Al-Azzawi has also produced illustrations to accompany collections of Arab poetry (‘Hymne de corps’ 1979, for example), that share the same stark visual language and predominant use of black and grey tones as Sabra and Shatila Massacre. Al-Azzawi’s work has consistently addresed the political events of the Middle East and previous series of works have included over forty gouaches from the 1970s reflecting on his military service fighting the Kurds. Sabra and Shatila Massacre represents the most significant and monumental attempt by the artist to address the turmoil in the region."
    },
    {
     "text": "Dia al-Azzawi was born in 1939 in Baghdad, Iraq. He is considered one of Iraq’s most influential living artists and a leading figure for the emergence of modern painting and printmaking in the country. In 1969 he wrote and published the manifesto ‘Towards the New Vision’, outlining the ambitions of himself and his contemporaries who were incorporating a semi-abstract language in works that drew on a Sumerian, Syrian and Islamic heritage. In the early 1970s, with Shaker Hassan a-Said (1925–2004) and Rafa al-Nasiri (born 1940), he established what became known as the One Dimension group which promoted the idea of an Iraqi or Arab identity through art and the use of calligraphy in modern painting."

    {
     "text": "Due to the scale of Sabra and Shatila Massacre, it has rarely been exhibited, aside from three years between 1983 and 1986 when it was on display at the National Council for Art and Culture, Kuwait. Given its significance in al-Azzawi’s work, however, it has been widely reproduced in catalogues devoted to his work and modern Arab art."

The violence was carried out by a militia associated with a Christian Lebanese right-wing party. The camps were under the guard of the Israeli Defence Force. Al-Azzawi worked on the drawings over several months, creating no other work. In its subject matter and scale, the work is related to Pablo Picasso’s Guernica 1937, a large painting that brought attention to the violence of the Spanish Civil War (1936–9)."

The clouds in the light blue sky are illuminated in pinks, oranges and purples as if at sunset or sunrise. Painted on top of this landscape is the seemingly unrelated phrase ‘THE MUSIC FROM THE BALCONIES NEARBY WAS OVERLAID BY THE NOISE OF SPORADIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE’ in a clean, modern font that is evenly spaced. This work belongs to a large body of paintings, begun in the 1980s, in which the artist Edward Ruscha overlaid landscapes with texts (see Pay Nothing Until April 2003, Tate AR00047, and Daily Planet 2003, Tate AR00048)."
    },
    {
     "text": "Unlike more recent examples of this type of composition, such as Pay Nothing Until April and Daily Planet which use acrylics, The Music from the Balconies is executed in oils. As a result the artist’s process of making the work is more visible in this painting than similar works produced in later decades. The text was applied using stencils and is presented in Boy Scout Utility Modern, a unique typeface created by the artist as a sort of ‘no-style’ (Richards 2008, p.82)."
    },
    {
     "text": "The Music from the Balconies is testament to Ruscha’s friendship with the writer J.G. Ballard. Throughout their respective careers the pair shared a common aesthetic sensibility concerned with the deleterious effects of contemporary life. The text presented in this painting is lifted from Ballard’s 1975 novel High-Rise, which charts the moral and social breakdown of an ultra-modern, residential tower block. Ruscha has described this painting as an ‘illustration’ of some of the novel’s themes and ideas (artist’s talk, Wolverhampton Art Gallery, 21 October 2011). While not directly representing the urban setting in High-Rise, Ruscha’s painting offers an intriguing visual analogue for some of the psychological tensions that underpin the novel. The jarring juxtaposition of pastoral imagery and rationally-designed typeface reflect the conflict between man and nature that unravels throughout Ballard’s novel. While the exaggerated palette of Ruscha’s landscape causes it to appear artificially simulated or chemically induced, which might also be seen as reflecting the interests of Ballard, who frequently explored the themes of drugs and advanced technology in his writings."
    },
    {
     "text": "The landscape represented in The Music from the Balconies appears to be inspired by the prairie landscapes of Ruscha’s childhood home of Oklahoma, although it could equally reflect the coastal prairies of California, his adopted home for many years. Seen in this light the prairie setting connects with the landscape tradition in American art and the wide-open vistas found in many of Ruscha’s paintings and photographic works dating back to the early years of his career. Likewise the saturated colours also recall the Technicolor film stock perfected during Hollywood’s golden age, highlighting Ruscha’s long-term interest in film and the Hollywood film industry, whose studios are located close to Ruscha’s own artistic studio."

     "text": "Boris Taslitzky made Riposte in direct response to current events. In the aftermath of the Second World War (1939-45), France fought to suppress claims for independence in its colonies in Indo-China which had just been freed from Japanese occupation. Supplies and troops were shipped from French ports, which became the focus for unrest. In 1949 the dockers of Port-de-Bouc, near Marseille, refused to load the ships and staged a strike which was broken up by armed police. The violence of this official action appalled Taslitzky, as the use of police dogs against French citizens raised memories of Nazi wartime atrocities. Drawing accounts from newspapers, he set out to encapsulate the conflict. He dramatised his image through sharpened colour and a spatial concentration created by the lighting and the pattern of the cobblestones. The details are deliberately emotive. At the centre a dog bites into the arm of a collapsing woman. The darkly uniformed police are largely faceless, with the exception of one held down in the foreground who resembles the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler (1889-1945). By contrast, the dockers are dressed in light colours, and they launch their 'riposte' using the available bricks. A woman seizes the French tricolore flag, symbol of the revolutionary ideals of 'Liberty, Fraternity and Equality', so that, by implication, she represents the true nature of French sympathies."
    },
    {
     "text": "In style, subject and scale Riposte demonstrates Taslitzky's admiration for the great nineteenth century painters Francisco Goya (1746-1828), Théodore Géricault (1791-1824) and Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863). The characterisation recalls the victims of execution in Goya's Fourth of May, 1814 (Prado, Madrid), while the woman with the flag echoes Delacroix's Liberty at the Barricades, 1834 (Louvre, Paris). Taslitzky's commitment to political art derived from the Communist Party's doctrine of Socialist Realism, which was first proposed in the early 1930s as a contemporary realism legible to the vast majority, for whom avant-garde art was considered abstruse. Taslitzky first emerged as a key practitioner of French Socialist Realism in the 1930s, as shown by his The Strikes of June 1936 (T07404). He resumed his social criticism on his return in 1945 from wartime imprisonment in the concentration camp at Buchenwald, where he had been interned as a communist by the Nazis."
    },
    {
     "text": "The strength of Taslitzky's work is demonstrated in the reception of Riposte when, in 1951, it reached the Salon d'Automne, which had already been the site of political controversy in the preceding years. Although hung by the committee, Riposte was among seven works protesting against the war in Indo-China (including a portrait submitted by Taslitzky under a pseudonym) that were removed by police as an 'offence to national feeling'. This was in preparation for the visit by the President of the Republic, Vincent Auriol (1884-1966, President 1947-54), and attracted a storm of publicity, ranging from the issue of censorship to the questionable legality of the action. The re-instatement and the removal again of some of the works - not including Taslitzky's - only served to prolong the authorities' difficulties. The prominent communist intellectual Louis Aragon (1897-1982) wrote a coruscating article, entitled 'At the Salon d'Automne: Painting has Ceased to be a Game'. He revealed that the arts Minister Baylot, who was responsible for the removals, had previously been the Prefect for the area of Port-de-Bouc at the time of the strikes."

One policeman resembles Hitler - an especially powerful device for an artist who had been imprisoned by the Nazis. A woman striker seizes the French tricolore, symbol of the Revolutionary ideals. Government ministers were so sensitive to the painting that they ordered its removal from an exhibition in 1951."

     "text": "The support for Riposte was prepared by the artist. The work was painted on one piece of sized, linen canvas with a fine threads and a close weave. A thin layer of off-white oil priming was applied over the linen surface. The canvas was then stretched over a heavy wooden stretcher with one horizontal crossbar and two vertical crossbars. The joints were expandable with squared mortise and tenon joints. The flat front profile of the stretcher bars contributed to the development of stretcher cracks on the front face of the painting. There was a small tear in the canvas, with raised and crackled paint, located at 700 mm left and 105 mm bottom.\nThin black lines visible around the paint indicate that the major design elements were first sketched on the priming, using an undetermined material. Taslitzky initially worked out his compositions for his large paintings in oil paint on artist board. The colour oil sketch for this work is currently displayed on the wall of the artist's studio in Paris.\nThe first layer of paint is thinly applied, almost scumbled over the surface. The priming is not exposed but the paint is so thin and transparent in some areas that the colour of the priming has a significant effect on the appearance of the painting. The canvas weave is visible in large areas of the background but, due to its fine threads and close weave, the texture is not a significant design factor.\nSubsequent layers of paint are brushed on thinly. There is little mixing of paint on the canvas, although the paint has been applied wet in wet in several areas. The brushwork is gestural with application in broad strokes of colour. Colours are layered thinly to suggest modelling and give depth to the surface. Some brush strokes are visible but the texture is generally smooth.\nThe surface was coated with a thick layer of glossy, natural resin varnish. It was applied unevenly, resulting in a few drips down the front and varying thickness. The resin has yellowed obscuring the paint surface.\nThe original frame was a wooden strip nailed to the outer edges of the painting.\nThe structure of the painting was in good condition upon acquisition but it required major treatment in order to make it displayable in a gallery. The work was coated with mud, dirt and mould from a previous exposure to water. There are some alligator cracks exposing the underlayers of paint or priming. In the paint film there are large areas of wrinkled paint that occurred due to an oil-rich paint consistency and areas of drying crackle. The stretcher was also contributing to the cracking of the paint.\nThe yellowed varnish interfered with the legibility of the image.\nThe painting was treated in 2002 in the Conservation Department at the Tate. The old stretcher was replaced with a new, expandable wooden stretcher. The mould and dirt were carefully removed. The varnish was cleaned from the surface. The tear was repaired and small scuffs and losses to the paint surface were retouched. A new varnish coat of Paraloid B72 was applied to the surface. The painting was installed in a new wooden frame. The painting is now in very good condition for display.\nPatricia Smithen\nAugust, 2001"

This example in lead is one of an edition of four bronze and two lead casts. It is inscribed 'Fautrier' and '3/6' and is stamped with the Valsuani mark, the foundry used by Fautrier for casting the majority of his sculptures. It is believed that the edition was completed before the artist's death in 1964. The other lead cast is in the collection of the Musée de l'Ile de France, Château de Sceaux, Sceaux."

     "text": "Fautrier was part of a Resistance circle of writers, poets, and artists in Paris during World War II. In January 1943 he was arrested by the Nazis because of this affiliation. He was released upon the intervention of the German sculptor Arno Breker and withdrew to Châtenay-Malabray, a mental asylum in the suburbs of Paris. The writer Jean Paulhan arranged for him to have a studio space in the sanatorium and, while there, Fautrier produced his most famous series of paintings and sculptures, known collectively as the Hostages ('Otages'). The Nazis used the forest surrounding the clinic to torture and execute prisoners and, although their actions were out of sight, the screams of the victims could be heard by those in residence. This harrowing experience is reflected in Fautrier's works. The manipulation of the material of Head of a Hostage, with its layered and scored surfaces, lends the appearance of mutilated flesh to the truncated form. Despite this apparent formlessness, a delicate profile is drawn out of the mass, just as occurs in a number of the paintings of the series. In this way, Fautrier combined elements of figuration and abstraction, conveying both the individuality of the hostages and the amorphous quality of anonymous bodies found in mass graves."
    },
    {
     "text": "The Hostage series was first exhibited at the Galerie René Drouin, Paris, in 1945. The paintings were hung closely in rows, an arrangement which suggested an association with mass executions. The stark portrayal of recent horrors, and the works' combination of beauty and aggression, made viewers uncomfortable. The poet Francis Ponge described the Hostages as 'tumified faces, crushed profiles, bodies stiffened by execution, dismembered, mutilated, eaten by flies' (quoted in Paris Post War, p.89). André Malraux, the politician, critic and writer, in his essay for the exhibition catalogue, traced a link between the sculptures and the paintings. He singled out Head of a Hostage as central to the series: 'The Hostage which is the key to all the others is the large hostage sculpture. Rather than coming from Fautrier's paintings, these figures come from his sculpture. From his sculpture which has found, through torture, what it had sought for a long time in vain: a means of incarnation.' Such a view was redemptive and Malraux went on to claim that Fautrier had created in his Hostages series 'the most beautiful monument to the dead of the Second World War' (quoted in Jean Fautrier, p.222).\nFurther reading:\nAftermath: France 1945-54, exhibition catalogue, Barbican Centre for the Arts, London 1982, pp.49-53\nJean Fautrier 1898-1964, exhibition catalogue, Musée d'art moderne de la ville de Paris 1989, reproduced p.164\nParis Post War: Art and Existentialism 1945-55, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1993, pp.89-103, reproduced p.94 in colour"

     "text": "Jean Fautrier produced twenty-two sculptures in the period between 1927 and 1944, all were based on the human figure. During 1940-4 he concentrated on a series of heads, of which Large Tragic Head is the penultimate and Head of a Hostage (Tate T07300) is the last. In each the head has been the site of a seemingly brutal attack, made all the more expressive by the evidence of the artist's physical manipulation of the material. Large Tragic Head, with its clawed and battered face, is a particularly potent example of Fautrier's work and led to his Hostage series of paintings and sculptures of 1943-5. All of these works were made under the threatening conditions of the German wartime occupation of Paris, where Fautrier was briefly arrested in early 1943. When his works were exhibited after the Liberation, they were seen to memorialise that collective experience. In 1945 André Malraux, the critic, writer and politician, wrote the catalogue introduction to the exhibition of the Hostage series. Though Large Tragic Head anticipates the series, it fits Malraux's description of them as 'the first attempt to dissect contemporary pain, down to its tragic ideograms, and force it into the world of eternity' (quoted in Paris Post War, p.89)."
    },
    {
     "text": "For Fautrier, art had to begin with reality. 'In matters of art', he said, 'all that comes from reality, on condition that it serves only as the initial thrust, appears more imaginative, more magic than anything which obstinately turns its back on it' (quoted in Jean Yves-Mock, 'Jean Fautrier', Apollo, vol.68, September 1958, p.83). This reflects Fautrier's overriding concern with the human condition. During the war he became acutely aware of the bleakness and potency of isolation, a state which 'offers us the purest and the most absolute solutions' (quoted in Paris Post War, p.90). Malraux described the response to wartime suffering found in Fautrier's works as an attempt 'to express the drama without representing it' (quoted in Aftermath, p.50). This may be felt in the balance between the striated part of Large Tragic Head and the delicate modelling of the remaining eye and gasping mouth. That Fautrier stopped short of completely obliterating the features - a tendency he pushed further in Head of a Hostage (Tate T07300) - suggests a desire to commemorate the victims of violence, while making that violence more pronounced."

     "text": "Untitled No. 8 (Shattered Glass) is a large collage of black and white photographs adhered to paper and mounted on board. The photographs show details of diversely textured and patterned urban surfaces, principally grids of wire mesh and details of shards of glass. Henderson has over-painted parts of the photographs in black ink to create an effect of splintering. This assemblage of large and mismatched photographs and brush-applied ink markings collectively creates an abstract pattern that evokes the fragmented surface of broken glass. The work was unglazed when acquired by Tate, and it was probably intended that it remain unglazed because of the subject matter.\nThis work unites the artist’s long-standing interest in the medium of collage with a fascination with the visual effects suggested by fragmented urban textures and surfaces. Henderson began experimenting with collage in the late 1930s, when he worked at the National Gallery as an assistant to the picture restorer Helmut Ruhemann. He returned to this medium after the war, around the time of the end of his studies at the Slade School of Art, where he was a student from 1945-9. At the Slade he had become close friends with fellow student Eduardo Paolozzi (1924-2005), who began working in collage from the mid 1940s. Later, Henderson and Paolozzi collaborated on Untitled (Study for Parallel of Life and Art) 1952 (T12444), a photocollage conceived during the planning of the exhibition Parallel of Life and Art, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1953, which they were both involved in curating. Henderson’s small Collage (T01915) of 1949 is a precursor to Untitled No. 8 (Shattered Glass). In the earlier work, the artist combined collage with oil paint to create a raw assemblage of textures in an abstract design suggestive of the urban environment.\nHenderson took up photography in the late 1940s, drawing on London’s East End where he lived for his subject matter. His attention was directed towards everyday street scenes, in which he identified diverse urban patterns and textures as found objects. In Chisenhale Road 1951 (P79313), Henderson uses a prosaic scene of children’s play to explore the abstracted patterns that emerge from the layering effects of distorted shadow on the etched markings of a hopscotch grid on the road’s surface. In other works, including Bag-wash 1949-53 (P79305), the artist focuses specifically on details of urban decay: weathered windows, torn signage, scratched and broken surfaces. With Untitled No. 8 (Shattered Glass), dating from 1959, Henderson rejects figuration and moves entirely to abstraction. It is thought that this work was exhibited in his solo exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1961 (listed in the catalogue as Big Photo Collage, Shattered Glass.\nUntitled No. 8 (Shattered Glass) refers to the Brutalist aesthetic that permeated Henderson’s work in the 1950s. Reflecting in 1978 on this period, he noted affinities between his art and the work of the French artist Jean Dubuffet (1901–85) (Nigel Henderson: Photographs of Bethnal Green, p.5). Dubuffet’s Large Black Landscape 1946 (T07109), for example, evokes the rawness of urban textures. Untitled No. 8 (Shattered Glass) is similarly hard edged, but, unlike the Bethnal Green photographs, suggests violent destruction rather than simply rawness or decay.\nFurther reading:\nNigel Henderson: Recent Work, exhibition catalogue, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, 1961.\nNigel Henderson: Photographs of Bethnal Green 1949-1952, exhibition catalogue, Midland Group, Nottingham, 1978.\nVictoria Walsh, Nigel Henderson: Parallel of Life and Art, London 2001.\nAlice Sanger\nDecember 2008"

The Surrealists' game involves a piece of paper, folded horizontally concertina-fashion onto which, in turn, each member of a group draws a part of a body, without being able to see what others have drawn on the paper. The final result is a body or character of composite parts. The Chapman brothers have collaborated artistically since the early 1990s and decided to use the game to emphasise the dual nature of their work together, exploring difference within a unit. In this case they drew onto etching plates instead of pieces of paper. Each brother created ten head sections and had them covered by an assistant before exchanging plates and proceeding with the torso sections. The plates were again covered and exchanged for the remaining sections, ensuring that all four parts of the etchings were randomly matched. On some images the quarterly divisions are clearly visible and the background shaded in a horizontal segment; on others the different parts are less distinct. The artists have used a range of different drawing styles making it hard for the viewer to identify any one section with any particular hand. A selection of tools and differing degrees of pressure on the plate have resulted in a variety of effects. One section has been created using tiny dots made with a delicate tool, many others are finely etched in intricate lines. Simpler cartoon figures contrast with convoluted, messy and highly textured areas. The project was completed in twenty days."

Disasters of War 1993 (Tate T07454) and Hell 2000 (Saatchi Collection, London) are composed of cut up and reconstituted bodies. The etchings feature imagery common to the Chapmans' work in other media: skulls, eyeballs on stalks, grotesque animal heads, liquids dripping and spurting from wounds, orifices, nipples and shower-heads, writhing intestines, claw-like hands and feet. Around the edges of the figures tiny spiders hang from threads and flies crawl. Insects' wings and branching roots appear in the place of limbs. The images recreate the worlds of such artists as Hieronymous Bosch (1450-1516) and Goya (Fransisco de Goya y Lucientes, 1746-1819) with a contemporary feel. The Chapmans have referred to their work as having an 'infantile dialectic' (quoted in fig-1: 50 projects, 50 weeks), expressed through their exaggerated, comic-horror aesthetic."

The Roman poet Ovid (1st century BC) described chaos as ‘a rude and undeveloped mass...all discordant elements confused, were there congested in a shapeless heap’. In 1850 Watts planned a series of murals representing ‘the progress of the cosmos’. Here he charts a path of evolution. Primeval confusion is represented by giants struggling to release themselves from fire and vapour. The establishment of measurable time and space is signalled by the chain of female figures to the right."

     "text": "Issei Sagawa 2014 is an oil painting on canvas. It is a portrait of a man wearing a large hat that is too big for his head and whose wide brim forms two large dark areas either side of his cheeks. The face is rendered with very loose brush strokes whose directions do not correspond to the posture of the body. Several colours, including greens, greys and pinks, mix across the face, picking up the dominant colours of the figure’s pink clothes and the green-grey background."

He was imprisoned for several years before being released and returning to Japan. Here Tuymans depicts Sagawa as a young man, before his later crime and notoriety. Prior to this painting Tuymans had painted Sagawa twice before (see, for example, Issei Sagawa 2012)."

     "text": "Issei Sagawa is one of several portraits by Tuymans based on images of people associated with acts of violence. His series Die Zeit 1988 included a painting of Reinhard Heydrich, the deputy chief of the SS in Nazi Germany, while Der Architekt 1997 (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Galerie Neue Meister, Dresden) was based on an image of the German architect Albert Speer, who served as a minister under Hitler. Whereas in Der Architekt white paint covers the subject’s face, in Issei Sagawa it is the vigorous and loose brushwork that effaces the murderer’s image. Issei Sagawa exemplifies Tuymans’s use of cropping to focus the viewer’s attention on the painted subject and the materiality of the work. He previously used this technique in works such as The Secretary of State 2005 (Museum of Modern Art, New York), a painting based on an image of Condoleezza Rice, who served as America’s Secretary of State under President George W. Bush."

     "text": "Untitled is a sculpture combining two pieces of furniture with poured cement. Salcedo removed the two doors and single drawer from an old-fashioned free-standing wooden wardrobe she had bought from an antique shop. She inserted an old wooden chair into the opening on one side, so that the seat is inside the body of the wardrobe and the back crosses the central partition on the outside, before sealing the three openings into the wardrobe with cement, poured onto a supporting metal armature bulked with styrofoam. Cement residue filling all the crevices in the wardrobe and chair emphasise the sculpture’s fused appearance and evokes the sealing of a tomb.\nThe forced union of disparate elements is a central feature of Salcedo’s sculptures of the late 1980s through the 1990s. Such works as Untitled, 1987 (T07836) and Unland: audible in the mouth, 1998 (T07523) merge structures that, the artist has commented, ‘don’t fit and appear to be like the mutated remains of an accident’ (quoted in Garcia-Anton). For Salcedo, the tension arising from the clash of materials expresses the emotional and psychological unease at the heart of her work, which is motivated by the traumatic effects of civil war on the Columbian people. The use of particular materials to express this was inspired by the work of German artist Joseph Beuys (1921-86), which Salcedo discovered while she was studying art at New York University in the early 1980s (MFA 1984). Beuys’s notion of ‘social sculpture’ – integrating political awareness with making – and his focus on materials to convey specific meanings were a significant influence on her practice. She has elaborated:"

    {
     "text": "The way that an artwork brings materials together is incredibly powerful. Sculpture is its materiality. I work with materials that are already charged with significance, with a meaning they have acquired in the practice of everyday life. Used materials are profoundly human; they all bespeak the presence of a human being ... The handling of materials in each piece is the result of a specific act, related to the event I am working on. It is an act of everyday life that gives shape to the piece. In some cases it is a hopeless act of mourning ... The processes go beyond me, beyond my very limited capacity, whether because one single person couldn’t possibly have made the work (Unland, 1995-8), or because of the brutality and massiveness of the act (untitled furniture sculptures, 1995-8) ... [In] the situation in which I live ... you can see advanced technology existing side by side with extreme forms of underdevelopment. Oppositions of this kind are part of my life ... reality is always disrupted, always severed ... it is not simply a mixture but a cruel juxtaposition of things striving violently to manifest themselves simultaneously ... The handmade element of the work marks not merely an absence of industrial values, but also a wholehearted rejection of rationalism. Paradoxically war is the maximum expression both of industrialism and of its destruction ... I’m interested in the notion of the artist as a thinker attuned to every change in society but at the same time producing art that is irreducible to psychological or sociological explanations."

     "text": "Untitled, 1998 is one of a large group of Untitled sculptures combining domestic wooden furniture with cement that Salcedo created during the 1990s. The first series was exhibited as a large group at the Carnegie International, 1995 in Pittsburgh before being dispersed. Tate’s work was part of an installation in Liverpool’s Anglican Cathedral during the first Liverpool Biennial in 1999. The sculptures, mainly comprising cupboards, chests, armoirs and wardrobes, alone or combined with chairs, bed frames, tables and other chests, resonate in a variety of ways. The level surfaces of the poured cement combined with more or less visible sections of steel armature have industrial associations allied with minimalist sculpture, which the blocking of space – either filling openings or creating actual blocks on and under chairs – enhances. These sculptures recall such works by British artist Rachel Whiteread (born 1963) as Untitled (Nine Tables), 1998 (T07984) and Untitled (Rooms), 2001 (T07938) in which empty space – the space under a table and the negative space of a room – appears solid. In contrast to the rough, heavy cement with its blank, impassive flat surfaces the wooden furniture in Salcedo’s work appears fragile and mortal. Made by craftsmen, by hand, the sculpture’s wardrobe and chair have a history of relationships with human bodies – those that made them and those for whom they were created. In relation to the cement, they stand in for bodies; although as their openings are closed they are bodies that can no longer function; they are sealed and silenced in a manner that powerfully evokes death and entombment. As well as uncomfortably fusing two or more pieces of furniture, Salcedo’s Untitled series often incorporates clothing into the layer of concrete filling the openings in the cupboards, drawers and cabinets suggesting even more poignantly the remains of people who are no longer alive.\nFurther reading:\nCarlos Basualdo, Nancy Princenthal and Andreas Huyssen, Doris Salcedo, London 2000, reproduced p.116 and pp.144-5 in colour.\nAnthony Bond, Trace: 1st Liverpool Biennial of International Contemporary Art, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery Liverpool, 1999, pp.130-3.\nKatya Garcia-Anton, ‘Silent Witness: Doris Salcedo at the Tate Gallery’, Art Newspaper, no.94, July-August 1999, p.21.\nElizabeth Manchester\nDecember 2007"

Rather than an empty space waiting to be filled with worldly belongings or childish fantasies, the wardrobe becomes hermetically sealed and inaccessible. The configuration of armoire and chair is akin to that of a Pietà, the traditional depiction of the Madonna holding the body of the dead Christ on her lap."

     "text": "Black Virtue is an oil painting made on three canvases that have been joined to form a long, horizontally orientated triptych. Each of the three parts of the triptych is a different width, resulting in an asymmetrical composition. The dominant colour in the painting is black, with further areas of red, green, blue, purple, brown, yellow and cream. In the two outer panels, the painted forms are largely abstract. The pictorial space of the panel on the left-hand side is articulated by floating fragments of black planes that open up the perspective into an organic, amorphous, cavernous space. In the narrower right-hand section there are fragmentary planes, some of which are laid next to one other, while others give the impression of partially overlapping on a flatter surface, without creating the impression of a deep perspectival pictorial space. In the central canvas, which is the widest, the painted forms are more linear and biomorphic than those that flank them. They are set against a black background and some of them take the shape of female sex organs."

In 1971 Matta stated that although he could not recall the exact significance of the painting’s title, it might ‘even refer to the so-called virtue in wartime of killing the enemy’ (quoted in Wilson 1975, p.16). The large areas of black in the painting may also allude to death (see Wilson 1975, p.16). Around the same period that he made Black Virtue, the artist worked on several other triptychs that the curator Ronald Alley has suggested were ‘based on the idea of introducing deliberate contradictions and opposing different elements, somewhat in the tradition of triptychs by Old Masters with a central panel and contrasting wings’ (Alley 1981, p.503). In a letter of 18 August 1971, the art dealer Pierre Matisse wrote that Matta made two other such triptychs the same year as Black Virtue was created: Prince of the Blood (Tragyptic) and Redness of Lead."

    {
     "text": "The artistic strategy of opposing different and even contradictory elements was inspired by the surrealist principles of automatism and free association. In order to achieve these effects, Matta made his paintings by covering over one part while he painted the next. In the period that he made Black Virtue, Matta was also working on an experimental project in ‘correspondence’ with the French poet Charles Duits. In this project, Matta would make a drawing and Duits would write a poem at eleven o’clock every morning, after which they would compare the results. Parts of the imagery of Black Virtue relate to a certain extent to some of these drawings."

     "text": "Matta joined the French surrealist group in 1937 under the encouragement of the movement’s founder André Breton. He became acquainted with key surrealist artists and published articles and illustrations in Surrealist journals such as Minotaure. Art critic and curator Simon Wilson mentions that in this painting Matta ‘was concerned with capturing the inner world of the mind’, claiming that ‘Black Virtue evokes a fluid mental landscape in an extreme combination of eroticism and violence’ (Wilson 1975, p.16)."

     "text": "The Director of the Tate, Norman Reid reported the Trustees’ response to the artist in October 1966. He wrote: ‘You had twice mentioned to me that you would like to have the chance of painting the carpet in our picture “Study for a Portrait on Folding Bed” and that you regretted having to let it go in its present state.’ As a precautionary measure the ‘very sympathetic’ Trustees suggested that he and Bacon discussed the changes as they worried that ‘you might be tempted to go on and make other changes and that they would finish up with a completely different picture’.[6] It is not clear whether such a meeting took place but Bacon would claim in 1974 that ‘they [the Tate] refused’ his request to ‘take it back to lay down a carpet’.[7] The consistent reference to a carpet suggests that he wanted to cover the ground plane with a mottled patterning, such as that found in Lying Figure with Hypodermic Syringe, 1963 (private collection),[8] rather than the more defined rug of Seated Figure, 1961 (Tate Gallery T00459). In the event, no changes were made to the painting."

    {
     "text": "The issue as a whole allows a glimpse of the pressures of Bacon’s reputation. On the one hand, the fears of the Tate Trustees may have been founded on the artist’s known tendency to destroy canvases in the process of reworking. As David Sylvester suggested to the artist in 1962: ‘If people didn’t come and take them away from you, I take it, nothing would ever leave the studio; you’d go on till you’d destroyed them all.’[9] This perceived attitude, which was comparable to that of Giacometti, allowed artistic uncertainty to be equated with a broader existential struggle. On the other hand, Bacon’s claim that a detail had been foreseen is given credence by evidence that he planned his work more carefully than hitherto suspected: preparing lists of subjects (such as recently acquired by the Tate)[10] and allotting definite periods for working on given canvases.[11] The demands of his dealer, which were implicitly at the root of the discussion, appear to have upset this system and resulted in Study for Portrait on Folding Bed being hurried from the studio before completion. Bacon considered it a failure. He regretted, in particular, the oval with mechanical details in the foreground, commenting many years later ‘I wish they would burn it’.[12]"
    },
    {
     "text": "When Study for Portrait on Folding Bed was first shown in 1963, one critic could write flamboyantly: ‘the humanity of us all is flayed to the naked flesh of this amorphous figure demonaic on the bloody striped mattress.’[13] It was, by this time, commonplace to consider Bacon’s painting as as concerned with violence and this particular assessment conflates an interpretation of the body’s image with its painterly treatment, or, as Ronald Alley has commented, combined ‘the expressive violence of his distortions and his handling of paint’.[14] Both views may be suggested by the heavily worked and blackened area at the centre of the body and the vertical drips falling from it. These suggest the chance elements which Bacon claimed for his painting in his interviews with Sylvester.[15]"
    },
    {
     "text": "The setting is quite broadly painted around the central figure. The raw (reverse) side of the primed canvas provides the colour for the ground plane. The main forms appear to have been sketched first in black, which was used for the upper framework identified by Melville ‘as a transparent box’,[16] as well as in the green paint visible in the supports of the spiralling white railing. The figure and bed were completed before the flat painting of the encircling brown wall and the thicker red-brown curve at the bottom which is laid over yellow; both areas allowed some of the working splashes to be disguised. Had the proposed carpet been added these drips, and an apparently accidental stain which undulates down from the left half of the bed, could have been covered. A small oval enclosure of forms in the lower foreground echoes the energy and colouring of the figure; its is difficult to identify, apparently including a mechanism comparable to a gramophone or to the turning handle of studio easels."
    },
    {
     "text": "In his dismissal of the painting Bacon allowed only that the ‘layout was rather good’.[17] This concession is significant in the light of James Nixon’s observation, in his geometrical analysis of Bacon’s work,[18] that ‘the linear composition is very similar to that in Study for Crouching Nude, 1952’ (Detroit Institute of Arts).[19] The space-frame, the curvatures defining the walls and floor, and the spiralling railing are all close enough to suggest a deliberate quotation. This appears to be a pragmatic re-use of what he considered to be an especially successful composition. Indeed, there are other instances of this practice: in 1959, he envisaged a painting - which may have emerged as Two Figures in a Room, 1959 (R.J. Sainsbury)[20] - consisting of a ‘man crawling on rail as in detroit [sic] picture against rock background’;[21] in 1966, he mentioned that he was using the same painting as a starting point for a new - and coincidentally failed - composition.[22]"
    },
    {
     "text": "Bacon is said to have claimed that the folding bed ‘was suggested by a photo reproduced in a Museum of Modern Art publication’.[23] Although no such source has been identified, his listing of potential subjects in 1959 included: ‘The bed of crime in centre of circular room | with carpet - non-patterned carpet’.[24] This may reflect the artist’s ideas of the cathartic effect of violent drama brought into the everyday.[25] Certainly the temporary nature and unmade state of the bed in the Tate’s painting establish it as a site of display and of squalor. In this connection, David Mellor has drawn attention to Keith Vaughan’s homoerotic barrack-room drawings as well as the concentration on prostitutes on beds in Sickert’s Camden Town paintings.[26] Noting the significance of the fact that Bacon at one time owned one of the latter,[27] David Mellor has observed that ‘it was the intimate, private body that was represented by Sickert, secreted and secreting - where gross, abject matter was well to the fore’.[28] Bacon’s displayed bodies, and especially those on beds, may be read as part of a shared iconography - in which the bed was the site of sex and crime - dismantling the ‘tradition of decorous public portraiture’.[29]"
    },
    {
     "text": "The character of Bacon’s beds has a certain continuity. The flat blue of the furniture was used in other paintings made at the same time,[30] while the blue-striped ticking of the mattress was a recurrent detail over a rather longer period. Two particular instances reinforce the reading of violence associated with the mattress: the contemporary Lying Figure with Hypodermic Syringe, 1963 (private collection)[31] and the central panel of Three Studies for a Crucifixion, 1962 (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York).[32] Bacon did not comment specifically upon the reclining figure in the triptych - being more concerned with the carcass of the right panel[33] - but he would later refer to the hypodermic ‘nailing the image more strongly into reality or appearance ... because I wanted a nailing of the flesh onto the bed’.[34] In both of these paintings the figure appears to be a female nude, whereas in Study for Portrait on Folding Bed it is apparently male and at least partially clothed: the rolled sleeves of the pinkened white shirt are bunched at the elbow. This distinction opens up possibilities for reading the figure in Bacon’s work, as Ernst van Alphen has suggested, whether it is the female as the ‘embodiment of sexual desire’[35] or the fragmentation of the male body as a ‘loss of self’.[36] Bacon’s identification of his mode of painting as an act of injury to the sitter[37] also suggests the anonymous body as ‘the object of action instead of its subject’ (in van Alphen’s formulation).[38]"
    },
    {
     "text": "The figure in Study for Portrait on Folding Bed demonstrates the way in which the density of paint was used in re-making the material quality of the body. The paint is bulked out with sand,[39] and this adds weight and texture in contrast to the smooth uniformity of the surroundings. Other techniques are in evidence. The whole area is speckled with fine black points of paint; these seem to have been relatively dry when flicked on, as they left a residue when dragged across the area of the elbow. The spots are associated with the more energetic area of black below, which is the origin of the long drips towards the base. This explosion is centred on the groin of the sitter, and may have concomitant sexual associations. Sweeps with the brush have described the positions of the legs (the sitter’s left foot is tucked under the right knee, and the right foot extended outwards) and then obscured them. They run across several white circles in the area of the legs and smaller green ones marking the toes; these appear to be made by off-printing from objects - perhaps a cork in the latter case. The energy of this paintwork is also present in the making of the shirt - pink over white with red at the collar - and especially the head. Here a variety of colours and forms combine to construct the features: red and yellow (comparable to the colouring of the base of the painting) appear in the hair and are set against lilac and purple in the ears. All combine in the face which is also overlaid with white in the forehead and the blackening of the eyes (which encouraged the description of ‘demonaic’); the bridge of the nose is marked with a spot of white squeezed straight from the tube. Although limited in area, this use of materials may be compared to the loading of paint by Bacon’s contemporaries both in Britain (such as Frank Auerbach) and in France (Giacometti, Dubuffet)."
    },
    {
     "text": "The mastering of the involuntary mark-making by ‘nailing the image ... into reality’ was essential to Bacon’s development of what has been termed by Gilles Deleuze (following J-F. Lyotard) a ‘figural’ art, in order to distinguish it from both ‘figurative’ illusion and abstraction.[40] The artist suggested to Sylvester in 1966 that adjustments to the features might become apparent in the process of painting through ‘a sort of graph’ of marks, and stated his desire ‘to be able in a portrait to make a Sahara of the appearance - to make it so like, yet seeming to have the distance of the Sahara’.[41] Extrapolating from this, Dawn Ades has commented on the ‘non-rational’ marks with which Bacon was able to ‘re-make a likeness’, so that ‘distortion, fragmentation, isolation ... are on one level the result of a pictorial battle against illustrative figuration’.[42] Like the artist himself, Deleuze has placed particular emphasis on the isolation of the individual in the paintings through the device of the rail set against and dividing it from the uniform background.[43] Although more concerned with the depiction of body as flesh than the transformation of the individual, Deleuze’s phenomenological approach allows a reading of the moving figure which ‘n’est pas seulement le corps isolé, mais le corps déformé qui s’échappe’ (is not only the isolated body, but the deformed body which escapes itself).[44] As such the painter’s practice bears comparison to the perception of the body and notions of the hysterical in the writings of his contemporaries, such as Artaud, Burroughs and Beckett.[45] In the particular case of Study for Portrait on Folding Bed such observations allow the spiralling rail to be seen as a zoning device and as a domestic furnishing which highlights the conceptual isolation and strangeness of the individual."

     "text": "Unland: audible in the mouth is one of a group of three sculptures collectively titled Unland that Salcedo created in 1995-8. The works are a response to the testimonies of children who witnessed their parents’ murder during Colombia’s civil war. As part of the process of creating the Unland works, the artist travelled to a northern region of the country to research the experiences of these orphans and the ways their lives developed as a result of their trauma. Unland: the orphan’s tunic, 1997 (Funcació ‘la Caixa’ Barcelona), Unland: irreversible witness, 1995-8 (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) and Unland: audible in the mouth (the last and most minimal of the series) were all made by fusing two old wooden tables into one. Salcedo bought the pine and oak tables she used to make Unland: audible in the mouth in Bogotá, where she lives and works. The two tables have been joined by sawing off the legs at one end of each table and fitting the legless ends together. The artist and her assistants drilled thousands of tiny holes into the tables’ surfaces before a team of volunteers laboriously threaded a combination of human hair and split silk fibres through the holes to cover much of the wood. The ‘stitching’ crosses the hybrid table against the length of the grain, and varies in density and colour. Salcedo used black and dark brown Colombian women’s hair she sourced from a local hairdresser and raw white silk. The silk threads are most dense at the end of the pine table, where they also encircle the legs and cover the sides; the ratio of silk to hair gradually decreases towards the central join where hair then supersedes silk on the wider oak table. Deep cuts scored lengthways into the table tops as part of the stitching process evoke controlled wounding, very different from the shallow grooves and notches scratched into the wood during its life as a table in a home. The surface of fine thread and hairs that cover much of the wooden surface recalls the veil of cobwebs that appears in abandoned places and on objects not touched for a long time.\nSalcedo studied art and art history at Bogotá University (BFA 1980) where she majored in painting and theatre and was particularly inspired by her teacher, the painter Beatriz Gonzalez (born 1938). She began making sculpture in New York in the early 1980s, while attending New York University (MA 1984). Here she encountered the work of Joseph Beuys (1921-86), whose notion of ‘social sculpture’ – integrating political awareness with making – and his focus on materials to convey specific meanings were a significant influence on her. She began to think of sculpture as ‘a crossroad, a meeting point’ (quoted in Basualdo, p.11), of ideology, theory, materials and objects. In New York, Saldedo also experienced being a displaced outsider – a sense she retained on her return to Bogotá in 1985, where she deliberately maintained her peripheral position in order to have a critical distance on Colombian society.\nSince the mid 1980s, Salcedo has based her work on the experiences of Colombian people whose lives have been damaged by the country’s civil war. During the 1990s, the artist interviewed the relatives of dead and missing people and did extensive research into the records of humanitarian workers. From these stories she created sculptures that poetically resonate with the affects of loss and horror resulting from the trauma of extreme violence. Salcedo invented the title Unland to express the conditions of dispossession and displacement created by war. In Colombia most of those suffering these conditions are in the most distant rural areas of the country and have no voice and no presence to make their suffering known. The word ‘un-land’ suggests a reversal of some kind – a place that is no longer a place, a country that no longer exists. ‘Un-land’ evokes the impossibility to imagine or to express the trauma suffered by children who see their parents die violently and whose lives are irrevocably damaged by this experience. The phrase ‘audible in the mouth’ is derived from a poem by the German-speaking Jewish Romanian poet Paul Celan (1920-70), whose writing was driven by the Holocaust in which his parents perished. To express horrors for which there were no words, Celan invented hybrid and fragmented words or forms of language, ultimately inspiring Salcedo to do the same. The phrase ‘audible in the mouth’, taken from Celan’s poem An Eye, Open, first published in a collection entitled Sprachgitter or Language Mesh (1959), evokes words that cannot be taken into the body in the normal way – through the ears – but rather through the rather more visceral channel of the mouth. The ‘audible’ words, like the victims and their stories, are displaced to a place where a different kind of hearing occurs – a non-verbal gut-impacting expression of permanent emotional damage to which Salcedo’s Unland sculptures attempt to give visible form. They transform the neutral association of tables – around which a family might sit to share a meal – to the disturbing notion of a prop on which a body might be fixed to be tortured or a dead body might be cut open. The intense and pointless labour of stitching wood with hair and silk suggests an attempt to repair the irreparable affective damage of war.\nFurther reading:\nTanya Barson, ‘”Unland” The Place of Testimony, Doris Salcedo’s Unland: audible in the mouth 1998’, Contemporary Art in Focus, Patrons’ Paper 3, January 2004, London, http://www.tate.org.uk/research/tateresearch/tatepapers/04spring/unland_paper.htm.\nCarlos Basualdo, Nancy Princenthal and Andreas Huyssen, Doris Salcedo, London 2000, pp.21, 25, reproduced pp.135, 136 and 138-9 in colour.\nUnland: Doris Salcedo: New Work, exhibition brochure, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 1999, reproduced [p.4].\nElizabeth Manchester\nDecember 2007"

These are scanned and printed renditions of the front and back of journalistic photos of car engines found scattered around the city of Beirut following bomb explosions during the war. The artist found the photos in the Lebanese press, such as the daily newspapers Annahar and As-Safir. The date of the explosion, the name of the photographer when known, and an English translation of the notes found at the back of the pictures are included at the bottom of each print. On the right hand edge of each of the prints, running vertically, is the name of the artist, the Atlas Group file that the work belongs to, the title of the file, and the date of production of the work. These framed prints, which the artist terms ‘dossiers’, are shown arranged in a rectangular grid on the wall. The work was produced in an edition of five, of which Tate owns the fourth.

The force of explosion causes the engine to soar tens and sometimes hundreds of meters away from the site where the bomb was detonated. As a result of this, car engines were found all around the city of Beirut, in such locations as balconies, roofs and nearby streets. Photographs of these engines were a common feature in newspaper reports at the time of the war. The repetitive presentation of these pictures can be seen as a comment on the banality of violence during war. Raad also explores the relationship between the details of the cars and the bombs used to explode them. The work may be understood as operating between research, archiving and ironic interpretation of a historic reality. Furthermore, it can be said to examine issues such as authorship, authority and authenticity, as well as the ways in which the history of Lebanon is documented and remembered."

The project is not an attempt to place blame or generalize suffering. Not all of the Lebanese people sustained physical or psychological harm from car bomb explosions, nor did all militias and armies use car bombs to terrorize, destroy, or kill. What our work demonstrates is that the detonation of a car bomb is not only an act of violence, but also produces a discourse that directly and indirectly affects individuals, families, and communities. We have found that the car bomb is both a cause and a consequence of the ongoing political, military, economic, and criminal conflicts that have defined most aspects of life in Lebanon for the past thirty years. The history of these car bomb explosions doubles as a history of how the wars were physically and psychically experienced, and how those who lived through such events speak about and assimilate their experiences."

     "text": "Ghost Story 2007 is a fifteen-minute single channel colour video projection with a voiceover that centres on a journey around Derry in Northern Ireland. The main location depicted in the video is a long empty pathway – flanked by woods on either side and a barbed-wire fence on the right – down which the camera slowly travels. At other times the camera moves through a derelict area with lock-up garages, a dark urban underpass and a patch of open wasteland on which a silver car is parked with a man sitting inside it. Interspersed with the footage of these landscapes, which are mostly seen in a murky blue-grey twilight with some brief night-time sequences, are occasional close-ups of eyes (both male and female) that gaze past the camera. Written by the creator of Ghost Story, the Northern Irish artist Willie Doherty, and delivered by the actor Stephen Rea in a dispassionate manner filled with long pauses, the voiceover details personal memories, often concerning murder and violence, that seem to be connected with the landscapes depicted in the video (text reproduced in Fruitmarket Gallery 2009, unpaginated). For instance, the narrator suggests that the trees contain ‘shadow-like figures’ whose terrified faces remind him of a crowd of people he once saw fleeing for safety. This video is shown on a loop in a dark, enclosed space, projected directly onto and completely filling a white wall that is between four and six metres wide, with two speakers playing the voiceover. Tate’s copy of Ghost Story is the artist’s proof, which was produced alongside an edition of three."
    },
    {
     "text": "The footage for Ghost Story was shot with a high definition digital camera in Derry – where Doherty was born in 1959 and where he continues to live and work – in December 2006, and its main location is a disused railway line that has been converted into a footpath. The work was edited by Doherty in a studio in Belfast in April 2007."
    },
    {
     "text": "As the title Ghost Story implies, Doherty’s video explores the idea of the past haunting the present. Both the movements of the camera, which may reflect the narrator’s perspective but which are so steady that they do not appear attached to a human body, and the words of the voiceover, which refer to ‘restless creatures whose intentions are often beyond our comprehension’ and figures who ‘inhabit a world somewhere between here and the next’, create a strong sense that spectral forces are at work in the video. The evocation of ghosts in the work can be related to the history of Northern Ireland, especially the violence associated with the Troubles, a period of political conflict that began in the late 1960s and is widely considered to have concluded in the late 1990s. Ghost Story suggests that the landscapes in the video may have once functioned as a stage for traumatic acts, even if little physical evidence of suffering is visible. As the curator Fiona Bradley has written, ‘There is a sense in the film that it is the ground as much as the man who is walking on it that remembers the bloodshed’ (Fiona Bradley, ‘Uncommon Ground’, in Fruitmarket Gallery 2009, p.6)."
    },
    {
     "text": "In exploring the legacy of the Troubles, Ghost Story can be compared with works such as Paul Graham’s photographic series Troubled Land 1984–6 (see Tate P79338–P79343), which depicts urban and rural landscapes subtly but discernibly shaped by the conflict. Doherty’s use of lengthy tracking shots in his video may also be aligned with the techniques employed by the British director Alan Clarke in Elephant (1989), a film that explores the violence of the Troubles through uninterrupted takes that culminate in brutal and unexplained murders."
    },
    {
     "text": "Although Doherty studied sculpture at Ulster Polytechnic in 1978–81, much of his work in the early 1980s consisted of black and white photographs overlaid with text. His first video work, The Only Good One is a Dead One 1993, is a two-screen installation focusing on a car journey that includes a voiceover relating the speaker’s thoughts, fears and fantasies about violence. In 2007, discussing his frequent use of spoken and written texts in his work, Doherty explained:"

These took the form of paragraphs printed on green paper. In the ‘Inflammatory Essays’ street posters, Holzer offset the texts on as many different colours as the printer could supply.\nIn the 1970s Holzer abandoned her practice as an abstract painter in order to make more explicit statements and to establish more direct contact with a larger audience than would visit galleries. Her art began to appear in the form of texts on posters which were exposed on the streets like fly-posters. In Jeanne Siegel's article and interview with the artist Holzer stated: ‘From the beginning, my work has been designed to be stumbled across in the course of a person's daily life. I think it has the most impact when someone is just walking along, not thinking about anything in particular, and then finds these unusual statements either on a poster or in a sign.’\nThe texts are provocative and their subjects range from the scientific to the political and interpersonal. According to Siegel almost any subject seemed suitable for exposition, with the exception of art which was deliberately avoided. Holzer explained to Siegel as follows:"
      },
      {
       "text": "What I tried to do, starting with the Truisms and then with the other series, was to hit on as many topics as possible. The truism format was good for this since you can concisely make observations on almost any topic. Increasingly I tried to pick hot topics. With the next series ‘Inflammatory Essays’, I wrote about things that were unmentionable or that were the burning question of the day."
      },
      {
       "text": "In contrast to the ‘Inflammatory Essays’ which consist of paragraphs of text, ‘Truisms’ were statements confined to a length of one line which were either displayed together on a poster or broadcast as a continuous light display.\nThe tone of the ‘Inflammatory Essays’ is aggressive and challenging. The texts are the invention of the artist, although they do not necessarily reflect the artist's own views. From one Essay to another they ‘display a spectrum of views, from far-left to far-right. I wanted to talk about things that are very important to people but in a non-didactic way (the series as a whole with its conflicting views is not didactic). I tried to show how dangerous and absurd it is to be a fanatic, but how important it is to get things done’ (letter to the compiler). They often have the air of slogans found in graffiti form on walls in the city.\nIn preparation she read ‘Mao, Lenin, Emma Goldman, various religious and right wing fanatics, miscellaneous American anarchists and some “folk” crackpot literature’. Her intention was to ‘write things that were very hot - in tone and subject matter - to (hopefully) instill a sense of urgency in the reader. I wanted the reader to jump, at least, and maybe consider doing something useful.’ To this end the posters were first ‘wheat-pasted in the streets of Manhattan. They were placed wherever posters normally appear’ but the choice of text was not always arbitrary. ‘Sometimes I'd choose certain texts for certain neighbourhoods. It was fun to put particularly frightening ones uptown.’ Each week Holzer pasted up a different poster. In order to make clear that a new poster was on display she had them printed on paper of different colours and ‘to let the viewers know that the posters were part of a series, I made each poster exactly 100 words long and 20 lines’ (letter to the compiler).\nWhen the posters are displayed in a gallery the artist likes ‘them to be pasted directly on the wall, from floor to ceiling with their edges overlapping slightly so that no wall shows through. It's good to completely cover a wall 10' × 25' in vertical or diagonal stripes of posters’ (letter to the compiler).\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1982-84: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1986"

The back half of the cast is suspended by white brushed Nylon rope lashed several times round the ankles and attached to a ceiling hook. This allows the front half of the casting to hang down with the toes just clear of the floor. The polyurethane rubber is pigmented rust brown with the addition of a mixture of artists’ oil colours. The neck of the cast has been reinforced with glass-fibre to reduce the risk of splitting. There is residue of brown and un-pigmented ‘yellowing’ rubber from the mould trapped in the cast, this is considered to be part of the work. A clear uneven knife cut edge is visible where some excess seams and residue on the cast have been removed. The back of the cast is shiny, the body contoured front is matt. The suspended figure is very fragile around the edges where the rubber is thin and there are several existing tears.\nThe artist noted in an interview in July 1997 that the original cast from his own body was made with alginate mould material (based on seaweed extracts) for the head, hands, feet and genitals. All these body parts were reassembled back into one body with plaster bandage backing for support. From this plaster body mould, a negative cast was made from Polyurethane rubber. The cast was split down the centre up to the neck, to lay the two body halves stretched out in line. A coating of wax release agent, to ensure clean and easy removal of the final cast, was applied to the inside of the final mould. Brown pigmented Polyurethane rubber was then poured into this mould thus forming the final stretched out sculpture.\nThere is no artist’s inscription.\nSandra Deighton\nOctober 1997"

In a letter to the compiler dated 1 June 1988 from Gabriele Wimmer, who translated the artist's responses to questions posed by the compiler, Wimmer wrote that the picture was painted at the artist's family home in Gainfarn, near Vienna, in an unheated room with normal lighting.

The artist bought it back in 1972, whereupon he '\"corrected\" the work' (letter to the compiler from Grabriele Wimmer, quoted above). In 1978, the artist relates, 'the painting was stretched and partly overworked because of artistic dissatisfaction' (ibid.). Rainer does not usually overwork earlier versions of works already completed. Comparing the present state to the earlier reproduction (in Kunstforum International, vol.26, March-April 1978, p.93) it appears that Rainer reworked the central, black vertical form to accentuate its bodily shape. Günter Rombold, in a letter to the compiler dated 26 July 1988, recalled discussing T03761 with Rainer during preparations for an exhibition in Berlin where the work was exhibited:"

To his astonishment he had discovered that the painting was in circulation in the art market once more. He bought it back for eight times the amount of the price he had been paid for it in 1957. This was not altogether a bad thing, because it gave him the opportunity to overwork the painting (until then a narrow brown cross over which streamed drips of red); a strong, black cruciform was the result of the overworking."

       "text": "At the end of the 1950s the then University Chaplain of Graz, Dr Ludwig Reichenpfader (died 1969), arranged for the chapel of the student quarters at Leechgasse 24 to be renovated. Through Monsignor Otto Mauer, the director of the Galerie nächt St Stephen in Vienna, who often gave lectures in Graz, Reichenpfader must have met Rainer. At any rate, Rainer was given the contract to design a crucifixion cloth and a movable cross. How much the contract was worth, I am unable to ascertain anymore ... The crucifixion cloth was hung across a large window which went on to the street. The light shining through the cloth gave it a special character. however, the spatial proportions of the room, at that time at the corner of the building, were completely inappropriate for a chapel. Only the two crucifixes created something approaching a religious focus within a room that was too high and too small.When in 1964 Dr Egon Kapellari became Student Chaplain, the whole house was renovated. By enclosing the foyer which became a gallery, a space on the first floor in the centre of the house became available to transform into a new chapel. This was done during 1965-6, with the architects Richard Gratl and Peter Thurner in charge. Their design was starkly functional and sober. They had no fundamental objections to Rainer's cloth. On the contrary, as students both Gratl and Thurner were sympathetic to the artists and aesthetic direction Mauer represented. The decision not to use the cloth was purely a practical one. The new space, with its continuous screen simply did not have sufficient height. In my opinion, the decision not to hang the cloth in the new chapel was less an aesthetic judgement against the cloth and more a realization of the irreconcilable nature of the cloth and its new setting. Another artist, Gerhard Moswitzer, was commissioned to design the new chapel. He made a steel cross (and later the tabernacle). In a quite different manner to Rainer's cloth, Moswitzer's steel cross represents an equally powerful 'struggle' with the cross. An accusation of aesthetic underestimation of Rainer's work cannot be levelled against Dr Kapellari, as Rainer's movable cross continued to be used for religious services in the chapel ... Dr Kapellari, now Bishop of Kärnten, did however give the cloth away, although this was not done irresponsibly. The cloth was given to Dr Hans Widrich, then director of the Afro-Asian Institute ... In exchange he gave the Catholic University Administration some graphic works by Markus Prachensky and Joseph Mikl, two artists supported at the time by Mauer. These graphic works were hung in various places throughout the building and were augmented over the years by other works given to us or bought by artists. As Widrich left Graz soon after, we no longer know what became of the cross."

It is, however, correct that I asked Dr Kapellari, the new chaplain, if it would be possible to acquire the Rainer cross [as opposed to T03671]. He turned down this request firmly and amicably, remarking that the work was a part of the spirituality of the house and must remain there ( I recall this from memory). We also talked about the cloth [T03671] and it became clear that evidently no-one knew of its whereabouts. Rainer later talked to me about the cloth and was most annoyed that it was back in the art market. I had not realised that until this moment. He also disclosed that he had bought back the work. Baloch mentions as an exchange for the Rainer graphic works by Prachensky and Mikl. Such a deal would have been an obvious deception. Because Dr Kapellari knew the value of contemporary Austrian art at the time, he would have opposed such moves most vigorously ... I repeat that I neither owned nor borrowed the Rainer cloth, either legally or illegally."

       "text": "I cannot say how Rainer's 'Wine crucifix' came to be owned by someone else, for the following reasons. At the time [i.e. the mid 1960s] the Catholic University Administration bought four other houses needing renovation. This was carried out painstakingly ... During this time the depot in the third storey was periodically unsupervised. As explained above the cloth could not be integrated into the new chapel, while the cross was always present and much valued. We can reliably dismiss the suggestion that the Administration sold the cloth. Some colleagues believe that the Rainer cloth was exchanged for graphic works by Mikl and Prachensky, works still owned by the Administration. Dr Widrich denies this version of events. There only remains one other possibility, that the unsupervised depot was illegally opened and the work thus later found its way onto the market."

Many of his black 'Overpaintings' (Ubermalungen) conceal a cross; and in his Body Language photographic works he has sometimes represented himself as crucified (e.g. in T03389). Questioned about his relationship to the church, Rainer said in an interview in 1971: ' There have been men and women in the church whose lives and thoughts touched me deeply. I myself still go through phases when I paint religious pictures - big black canvas for example' (‘Elf Antworten auf Elf Fragen' in Otto Breicha (ed.), Arnulf Rainer Hirndrang, Salzburg 1980, p.55). Rainer's meeting with Monsignor Otto Mause, a priest at St Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, who also founded the Galerie nächst St Stephen, was decisive in this respect:"

       "text": "I had many discussions with him at that time and it was he who made it clear to me that connections between religion and artistic creativity, as I saw them, weren't as peculiar as they seemed. He felt that the same way himself about them ... He visited me in my studio, looked at my pictures, chose and bought two of them. And then he made me an offer to have an exhibition in his gallery. I became interested. In those days I had a very particular and rather extreme profile as an artist. It was a daring thing to mount an exhibition of my work. I was amazed how spiritually involved Mauer was; as far as he was concerned, there was no difficulty in relating religion to modern art, which was prevalent at that time in Christian circles. By contrast Mauer seemed shaped by his contact with this form of art. He certainly wasn't a ‘progressive' priest. Theologically he was more traditionally orientated. But he was an incredibly intelligent and articulate man with an extraordinary wide horizon. He was capable of relating things to each other, which was certainly not an everyday achievement. He had important functions in the Church, though there were wide circles within the Catholic world, which absolutely rejected him and, in fact, actually saw in him a particular sort of demon. This was especially because of his contacts with artists. As far as we were concerned he emanated great spirituality as well as being a totally charismatic person. He used to preach sermons which were real works of art. And he gave himself up so utterly to his theme that he literally swayed in ecstasy in the pulpit. He fascinated all of us, just as great artists fascinate (ibid., pp.92-3)."

The exhibition was accompanied by a publication entitled Kreuz und Nacht ('Cross and Night') with a text by the theologian Louis Chardon. The following year Otto Mauer himself wrote a catalogue introduction in which he said that ‘Rainer creates curtains which gradually form themselves out of hundreds of layers of brush strokes and line, black and coloured hangings' (Breicha [ed.] 1980, p.58). In the interview with Mennekes, Rainer reveals what Christ means to him and goes on to describe his first picture of Christ:"

It was a stylistic platitude. So I went on painting and the figure of Christ became a cross. And finally, this cross became veiled by a dark cloud. But I am quite satisfied that something is still perceptible. It doesn't even have to be consciously perceptible. He [Christ] withdraws when we attempt to represent him. Perhaps he is there in an intimation, in an extinguished, fragmentary way. In certain signs. And yet he even withdraws there. As soon as one thoughtlessly repeats it (Breicha [ed.] 1980, p.98)."

Through it I have come more and more to paintings in dark colours - of course not totally black. There is always a small bit of light, mostly at the edge or in a corner. At the beginning I didn't want to do any ‘overpaintings'. I wanted to paint specific subjects. But it was always black, black and black again which came to me. I just couldn't do anything else. I had no idea beforehand that it would turn out like this. More than once, I tried to break away, but it was impossible. I realised that the quality and truth of the picture only grew as it became darker and darker (Breicha [ed.] 1980, p.94)."

       "text": "This painting is typical of Masson’s style of the early 1920s. The placement of the musical instruments (a mandolin and the curving body of what appears to be a guitar) on a tabletop, and the rhyming of straight and curved lines, allude unmistakably to the pre-war cubist paintings of Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) and Georges Braque (1882-1963).\nAlthough the neck of the mandolin appears as if seen from more than one perspective, there is no real attempt to employ the facets, planes or abstruse signs of cubist form language. Instead the painting seems largely realist in conception, with overt references to traditional still-life painting in the presence of the flowers, fruit and dead bird. In this sense, the painting could be seen as reflecting to some extent the themes – if not the values – of the post-war ‘return to order’ movement in France, which advocated qualities of clarity and harmony, and a modern reading of traditional art. But the unexplained elements, the strange spatial qualities and bleached coloration of his paintings of this period indicate a new and individual approach.\nRecalling the works of this period, the poet Georges Limbour – a friend of the artist from the earliest days – stressed the unnatural atmosphere of Masson’s paintings. He described the painter as a ‘magician’ who concealed secrets and mystery behind everyday appearances. ‘Wand in hand, and putting objects back to rest in their forms, André Masson seemed to approach painting along the path of calmness. But this calmness was all appearance. Behind it lurked disquiet and a certain metaphysical passion.’ The bleached tones lent his imagery an ethereal quality. Masson, Limbour wrote, ‘used a great deal of white, broken by a variety of reflections, the emotional substance of his dreaming. His early still-lifes were touched with those bewitching whites, and every object had a disturbing and somewhat nocturnal appearance: they seemed to be wearing a sort of white mask’. (Limbour 1947, p.v.)\nBehind this white mask were indeed not only dreams – suggested perhaps by the spherical cloud forms in the background – but also darker emotions. If the flowers and dead bird could be seen as evoking life and death in somewhat conventional terms, the red pomegranate halves expressed an altogether more bloody and violent vision. The fruit’s seeds can be said to symbolise the force of life and regeneration, but the red interior also evokes viscera. Later Masson was to acknowledge that the pomegranate – the French word for which also means grenade – evoked for him the memory of the blown-open skull of a soldier in the battlefields of Champagne. His experience of serving in the trenches for three years in the First World War, and of being left for dead in a battle, had scarred him profoundly both physically and mentally, and surfaced in the violent and carnal imagery of some of his later work.\nFurther reading\nGeorges Limbour, ‘Scenes of Everyday Life’, translated by Douglas Cooper, in Michel Leiris and Georges Limbour, André Masson and his Universe, Geneva and Paris 1947, p.iv-vii\nDawn Ades, André Masson, translated by Jacques Tranier, Paris 1994\nJennifer Mundy, ‘André Masson’, in Jennifer Mundy (ed.), Cubism and its Legacy: The Gift of Gustav and Elly Kahnweiler, exhibition catalogue, Tate Modern, London 2004, p.74, reproduced p.75 in colour\nJennifer Mundy\nDecember 2003\nRevised by Giorgia Bottinelli\nJune 2004"

The support has been subsequently glued onto a secondary linen lining canvas, probably with animal glue. The two pieces of fabric are attached to a four-membered expandable stretcher with ferrous tacks at the edges. The stretcher maybe original. The support is in a good condition although there is a slight damage to the rear of the left stretcher bar, where the outer part of the wood appears to have collapsed into a tunnel. This area runs for approximately 90 mm along the grain of the wood.\nThere maybe some tears in the support and thus why it has been lined. There are certainly two strips of retouching, which may be covering damages to the fabric. The largest tear is located 195 mm from the top and 130-190 mm from the left edge and a smaller one is visible at 105 mm from the top and 210-230 mm from the left. There are also a previous set of tacking holes visible around the edges and two additional holes are seen on the face of the painting at the top edge, 120 and 330 mm from left.\nThe ground preparation is obscured by a pigmented ground above and the lining canvas beneath. It appears to consist of a commercial oil priming of 1-2 thin layers. The canvas weave is still very evident. The paint appears primarily matt but its appearance was obscured by the thick, glossy varnish. The paint is vehicular but varies in its consistency from a paste to very lean paint. It was applied with a brush in a varied manner. Many areas are extremely thin, the mandolin for example, whilst there is some appreciable impasto in the details of the flowers and the dead bird.\nThere is some abrasion to the ground in the two main areas of paint loss and at all four corners. These abrasions have been retouched obscuring the extent of paint loss. This retouching now appears significantly whiter than the surrounding area. It lies above the varnish layer and will be removed during varnish removal. The varnish layer is possibly the original and is now extremely yellowed and thus very visually disturbing. There is also a thick layer of household dust over the varnish, which renders the painting rather dull and grey."

However he subsequently discovered that fibreglass is not satisfactory as the only medium for sculpture such as ‘Genghis Khan’ which consists of broad curved surfaces, as it tends to distort and mark. He therefore remade the sculpture in 1971–2, on this occasion in an edition of three. It is still made of fibreglass, but it is supported on a steel frame to prevent the distortion of the fibreglass shell. The original ‘Genghis Khan’ has been destroyed. The first version of the new edition belongs to the Peter Stuyvesant Collection, the second to the Tate Gallery, the third to the State University of New York."

The form of ‘Genghis Khan’ relates to ‘Rosebud’ 1962 and ‘And the Birds began to Sing’ 1964. All three sculptures comprise sheets which wrap around each other to form a cone. However, none of the sculptures arc self-contained cones: in all of them forms unfurl or explode, or in the case of ‘Genghis Khan’ flow outwards. The artist said (Interview with John Coplans, op. cit.): ‘The struggle of matter towards expansion, movement and change is set against the awareness of the static controlling forces of inert matter. Hence the often recurring use of the cone as a very large, very much earth-bound shape that will provide maximum challenge in an effort towards expansion.’"

      {
       "text": "Q: ‘Do you deliberately seek some kind of geobiomorphic form or imagery, some kind of a segmental view of nature or perhaps something similar. If so, what kind and why ?’\nA: ‘I would say formal themes run through my mind for long periods at a time. In their general characteristics they relate to formal problems, but in the working out of an individual piece, associations to natural forms, phenomenal events or contemporary imagery do crop up, they remain of secondary importance and their main value lies in the fact that they help to formalise an idea which seems to exist in the mind mostly in terms of feeling and shapes based around a formal event. For instance, when I made ‘Genghis Khan’ I did not think of mountains and clouds, but the idea was based around a bursting event using flowing forms, bounded in by side walls and the ground.’"
      },
      {
       "text": "Q: ‘Is your sculpture frontal ?’\nA: ‘I do not want my sculpture to have a main viewing point or front but to be a front. Two dimensional elements exist but they play against three dimensional ones and articulate the objects according to its needs. Outside contour can work with or against inside shape, making it more or less tangible. The use of simple horizontal vertical co-ordinates, tend to make points along the sculpture. But these tangible factors may disappear or be reduced in relation to other factors. For instance, the all round contour of ‘Genghis Khan’ has more formal entity than the ground contour and it also echoes it and dominates it, thereby helping to make the sculpture float off the ground.’"

The dull purple indigo of ‘Genghis Khan’… usually has the symbolic function of implying regality. King’s work is notably free of figurative connotations but the emblematic presence of a warrior-chieftain is inescapable here.’"

The work traces the history of airplane hijackings through found video footage and televised images. Grimonprez juxtaposes this central narrative with references to the Cold War and quotations from Don DeLillo’s novels 'White Noise' and 'Mao II'. Examining the abundance of information available via the media, much of which is spectacular and sensationalist, Grimonprez acknowledges the hidden or unseen events which cannot be recorded. He thus presents the viewer with the potential impossibility of documenting historical fact."

These took the form of paragraphs printed on green paper. In the ‘Inflammatory Essays’ street posters, Holzer offset the texts on as many different colours as the printer could supply.\nIn the 1970s Holzer abandoned her practice as an abstract painter in order to make more explicit statements and to establish more direct contact with a larger audience than would visit galleries. Her art began to appear in the form of texts on posters which were exposed on the streets like fly-posters. In Jeanne Siegel's article and interview with the artist Holzer stated: ‘From the beginning, my work has been designed to be stumbled across in the course of a person's daily life. I think it has the most impact when someone is just walking along, not thinking about anything in particular, and then finds these unusual statements either on a poster or in a sign.’\nThe texts are provocative and their subjects range from the scientific to the political and interpersonal. According to Siegel almost any subject seemed suitable for exposition, with the exception of art which was deliberately avoided. Holzer explained to Siegel as follows:"

       "text": "What I tried to do, starting with the Truisms and then with the other series, was to hit on as many topics as possible. The truism format was good for this since you can concisely make observations on almost any topic. Increasingly I tried to pick hot topics. With the next series ‘Inflammatory Essays’, I wrote about things that were unmentionable or that were the burning question of the day."
      },
      {
       "text": "In contrast to the ‘Inflammatory Essays’ which consist of paragraphs of text, ‘Truisms’ were statements confined to a length of one line which were either displayed together on a poster or broadcast as a continuous light display.\nThe tone of the ‘Inflammatory Essays’ is aggressive and challenging. The texts are the invention of the artist, although they do not necessarily reflect the artist's own views. From one Essay to another they ‘display a spectrum of views, from far-left to far-right. I wanted to talk about things that are very important to people but in a non-didactic way (the series as a whole with its conflicting views is not didactic). I tried to show how dangerous and absurd it is to be a fanatic, but how important it is to get things done’ (letter to the compiler). They often have the air of slogans found in graffiti form on walls in the city.\nIn preparation she read ‘Mao, Lenin, Emma Goldman, various religious and right wing fanatics, miscellaneous American anarchists and some “folk” crackpot literature’. Her intention was to ‘write things that were very hot - in tone and subject matter - to (hopefully) instill a sense of urgency in the reader. I wanted the reader to jump, at least, and maybe consider doing something useful.’ To this end the posters were first ‘wheat-pasted in the streets of Manhattan. They were placed wherever posters normally appear’ but the choice of text was not always arbitrary. ‘Sometimes I'd choose certain texts for certain neighbourhoods. It was fun to put particularly frightening ones uptown.’ Each week Holzer pasted up a different poster. In order to make clear that a new poster was on display she had them printed on paper of different colours and ‘to let the viewers know that the posters were part of a series, I made each poster exactly 100 words long and 20 lines’ (letter to the compiler).\nWhen the posters are displayed in a gallery the artist likes ‘them to be pasted directly on the wall, from floor to ceiling with their edges overlapping slightly so that no wall shows through. It's good to completely cover a wall 10' × 25' in vertical or diagonal stripes of posters’ (letter to the compiler).\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1982-84: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1986"

Two women sit drinking tea at a dining table, one listening attentively as the other laments her husband’s violent behaviour. Her words (which give the work its title) are presented in Russian script in a text box in the top right hand corner of the painting. A bed in the background locates the scene in a Russian communal apartment, where a single room often served as bedroom, dining room and lounge. The muted colours and bichromatic design enhance the resigned postures of the two women, imbuing the work with a sense of ennui that conflicts with the drama of the situation they are discussing."

The series was produced between 1992 and 1996 in Prague, the city to which the artist emigrated in 1982. The title Apartment 22 is a reference to the Moscow communal apartment where Pivovarov lived with his mother as a child. Most of the scenes are set inside the apartment building and several contain the image of the mother and the young Viktor. While Pivovarov generally excludes specific period references in these works, he has clarified that the setting is ‘Moscow in the 1950s as [my] own memory can remember it’ (Pivovarov in conversation with Tate curator Antonio Geusa, November 2014)."

However, while elements of the stories told in Apartment 22 are based on Pivovarov’s personal recollections of daily life in the post-war Soviet Union, the characters, objects and text in the paintings are not directly autobiographical. Instead they are based on extracts from a fictional diary written by the artist. The diary recounts the experiences of his invented character Grigory Sergeevich Tatuzov, an impoverished musician living with his partner Mariya in one of the rooms of Apartment 22. The diary takes the form of notebooks which survive as physical objects. The quotidian theme of the series is complemented by Pivovarov’s use of domestic materials such as enamel paint."

       "text": "Pivovarov was one of the founders of Moscow conceptualism, an underground art movement that emerged in the Soviet Union in the 1960s. The Apartment 22 series is one of his most famous and incorporates key characteristics of his practice. The paintings in the series have been exhibited extensively as individual works, in groups and occasionally all together, including in Pivovarov’s retrospective exhibitions at the State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, in 2004, at the State Russian Museum, St Petersburg, in 2004 and at the Moscow Museum of Modern Art in 2005 and 2011. Pivovarov was also part of the Sretensky Boulevard Group, a loosely associated community of artists with neighbouring studios in the Russian capital that included Ilya Kabakov and Erik Bulatov. Like many Soviet nonconformist artists, Pivovarov also maintained a career as an official artist, and he was a respected and popular illustrator of children’s books and magazines. This experience is reflected in the style of Apartment 22, where simplistic design belies an allegory that exposes the underlying mechanisms of Soviet society."
      },
      {
       "text": "Although created in the 1990s Apartment 22 epitomises the ethos of Moscow conceptualism. Towards the end of the 1980s, after a period in the late 1970s and 1980s in which he focused more on geometric abstraction and surrealism, Pivovarov returned to producing work more closely linked to his earlier practice. The focus upon the private lives of fictional Russian citizens forced to undergo communal living is a theme that he shared with his close friend Kabakov. This exemplifies Pivovarov’s belief that ‘the stronger the pressure from the outside, the greater the intensity of inner life’ (Pivovarov in conversation with Tate curator Antonio Geusa, November 2014). In Apartment 22 Pivovarov also follows his work of the mid-1970s that focused on the theme of loneliness. The artist has described his characters as experiencing the ‘fourth level of loneliness … the attaining of a true freedom and the joining with the infinite’ (quoted in Rosenfeld and Dodge 1995, p.321)."

      {
       "text": "The intricate combination of image and text, particularly in the context of the mundanity of Soviet existence, is a defining characteristic of Moscow conceptualism. In the Apartment 22 paintings the letters are made to look like rudimentary stencils on a noticeboard of the kind encountered daily by Soviet citizens. The ambiguous relationship to reality is also a key aspect of Moscow conceptualism. While the series is based on a fictionalised account, factual references are woven into the narratives, and the false sense of reality highlights the often surreal quality of life in the Soviet Union. Rather than providing an idealised account of life – a feature of the official Soviet art of socialist realism – Apartment 22 instead focuses on what is missing from life. Pivovarov has stated: ‘Mine is not a nostalgic look at my personal past. I would rather say that “melancholy” is the key word to a better understanding of the whole series.’ (Pivovarov in conversation with Tate curator Antonio Geusa, November 2014.)"

In the former, the setting is again an apartment room, though this time devoid of inhabitants. In the latter the text that gives the work its title becomes main image in the painting, a device used a number of times throughout the series."

      {
       "text": "Jantjes was born in Cape Town, South Africa, and studied fine art at the University of Cape Town (1966-9). He left South Africa in 1970 after being awarded a DAAD scholarship to study at the Staatliche Hochschule für bildende Künste in Hamburg, Germany (1970-2). A South African Colouring Book was produced in Hamburg in 1974 and 75. It is a series of eleven poster-type prints made up of image and text presented in the guise of a child’s colouring book. Each page is screenprinted from a collage, based on a gridded background, comprising photographs, newsprint, drawings and sections of printed, stencilled and handwritten text. A drawing book logo is stamped on the black portfolio cover and on many of the prints. Similarly a row of six blocks of colour may emphasise the ‘colouring’ activity. Additional sections of text are attached by paper clip to several prints. The titles all refer to colour – the concept central to race discrimination in South Africa which is the principal subject of this work. Jantjes used a combination of personal material – such as his own identity pass card, defining him as a ‘Cape Coloured’ (see Tate P78648) – with material culled from the external world including financial market reports in the newspapers (Tate P78653), cultural texts (Tate P78649) and photographs by the black South African photojournalist Ernest Cole (1940-90) who documented the sufferings of black South Africans during the 1960s (Tate P78649-52). Images of black miners, massacred innocents and exploited workers combine with excerpts quoting the words of B.J. Vorster (1915-83), South African Prime Minister (1966-78) and upholder of the apartheid regime (Tate P78647, P78650 and P78654).\nThe True Colours of the State extends the notions of colouring in and skin colour to the notion of colouring truth. Throughout the apartheid years, the Government consistently denied the violence which they used to oppress the African people of South Africa. The image on this print shows a crowd being beaten by police with truncheons. Many people in the crowd are sitting on the ground in non-aggressive poses. Jantjes has labelled ‘women and children’, ‘black policemen’ who stand watching and a ‘bridge’ and ‘river bank’ on the photograph which is printed onto olive-green card. A small section of text attached to the top of the print by paperclip quotes Prime Minister Vorster at the House of Assembly Debates in Parliament, 7 February 1969 claiming: ‘if anyone wants to declare outside this House that the peace and order existing in South Africa are the result of compulsion exercised by the Government, then I say it is a lie.’ The subsequent two prints in the portfolio, Colour these People Dead and Dead (Tate P78655 and P78656), show the aftermath of the infamous Sharpeville massacre, continuing Jantjes’ point about the true nature of the South African regime.\nA South African Colouring Book superficially recalls the series of death and disaster prints by American Pop artist Andy Warhol (1928-87). However, Warhol’s prints are commodity related, while Jantjes’ are overtly political in their message. Jantjes has emphasised that history is central to culture and that African art has always been dependent on a wider cultural and political sphere. He has stated that: ‘African works of art appear meaningless unless seen in relation to Africa’s cultural and historic reality ... The environments of today’s Africa demand liberation from inhumanity. Can the art of Africa ignore this demand? Can it be anything else than art for liberation’s sake?’ (Quoted in Gavin Jantjes: Graphic Work 1974/1978, p.7.) During the 1970s, Jantjes saw his work as playing a particular role in the struggle against the oppressive apartheid regime – more specifically to speak and be heard in what he called the dominating colonial ‘culture of silence’ in which the oppressed peoples had no voice. In 1978 he wrote: ‘the Colouring Book project was my first step out of the culture of silence. It is therefore dedicated to all those struggling for humanity and equal rights.’ (Quoted in A South African Colouring Book, [p.1].)\nA South African Colouring Book was produced in an edition of twenty. Tate’s copy is the eighteenth in the edition.\nFurther reading:\nWarren Siebrits, States of Emergence: South Africa 1960-1990, exhibition catalogue, Warren Siebrits Modern and Contemporary Art, Johannesburg 2002, reproduced [p.26] in colour\nGavin Jantjes: Graphic Work 1974/1978, exhibition catalogue, Kulturhuset Stockholm 1978\nGavin Jantjes, A South African Colouring Book, Geneva [1978?], reproduced [p.10] in colour\nElizabeth Manchester\nSeptember 2005"

A straight black line dissects the image just right of centre, indicating some sort of instrument which appears to have sliced through the disembodied fleshy limb which occupies the canvas. The title of the work underlines the violence of the gesture. To the left of the image, putrid fluid flows out of one of the shapes, while what appears to be blood drips down the centre of the canvas, evoking a sense of violence and decay. The image is deliberately ambiguous; Janas has commented: ‘I’d say my intention is to intrigue, unsettle, confuse, mislead and throw red herrings. I try to avoid explaining my paintings.’ (Janas and Szymczyk 2005, p.2.)"

       "text": "Slash is characteristic of the large-scale paintings Janas has made since the late 1990s. Positioned between figuration and abstraction, his works often depict ambiguous shapes that suggest body parts, fluids and organs. Despite this apparently representational subject, the composition of Slash is essentially abstract, with a strong formal design. The picture plane is roughly divided into a series of five triangles. Curator Sarah Cosulich Canarutto has written, ‘in his challenge to painting, Janas enacts a metaphorical battle between the formalism of geometry and the instinctive passion of expressionism. The counter collision of figure and form generates on the canvas an interweaving of picture planes and a consequent sense of depth, without establishing a spatial hierarchy’ (Sarah Cosulich Canarutto, ‘Piotr Janas: Istituto del Cervello’, Cardi Black Box, Milan 2010, http://www.ardiblackbox.com/ENGtesto_janas.php, accessed 1 November 2010)."

Janas has described his approach to painting as one of simplification and a return to basics: ‘I think that painting hasn’t done justice to basic functions performed with the aid of simple tools. To put it more generally, culture, and art specifically, has reached such rarefied heights that it’s almost suspended in a vacuum, and in my opinion the only way to go is down, we need some kind of reduction, simplification.’ (Janas and Szymczyk 2005, p.2.) This simplification can be seen in his choice of colours. Commenting on his preference for a limited palette he has stated:"

       "text": "Untitled is a black and white poster featuring an image of graffiti that reads ‘IT’S A NICE DAY TO BE OUT/SHOT’. It looks as though somebody has sprayed a line through the word ‘OUT’ and replaced it with ‘SHOT’. It is one of a group of three posters Olesen created that are similar in their conception, their execution and the messages they convey (see Untitled T11954 and Untitled T11955). These are enlarged printouts of photographs of homophobic graffiti that the artist found on the internet and that are exhibited pinned or stuck with double sided tape to the wall. Of identical size, each poster is constructed from thirty-two computer printout sections joined together on the reverse with adhesive tape. The sections are joined together in a casual and low-tech manner that mirrors the low-resolution quality of the photographic imagery. Each is unique, printed only once. They are usually all shown together, in a vertical configuration, as recommended by the artist.\nIn his appropriation of the words ‘IT’S A NICE DAY TO BE OUT/SHOT’ Olesen plays with the ongoing battle between the homosexual and the homophobic, and the non-acceptance of the former by society, simply but powerfully expressed in the cancellation of the word ‘OUT’ (which alludes to the phrase ‘coming out’, meaning publicly accepting one’s homosexuality) and its replacement by ‘SHOT’. The phrase, which seems to have originally been sprayed in white by somebody onto a contrasting a dark wall, in the poster recalls a bas-relief. This is a result of its enlargement by the artist, and the printing of the image using an inkjet printer. Olesen here problematizes the messages carried in the images he uses by enlarging them and accentuating them, thus rendering them more blunt and vulnerable to criticism. By taking the images out of the potentially unlimited public sphere of the internet, and transforming them into unique art objects, destined to exist in an entirely different public sphere, the artist invests them with greater symbolic value. Raising them to high art status and preparing them for exhibition in the art institution is in itself a politically charged gesture, which functions through both irony and awareness-raising.\nOlesen’s work deals with various dimensions of repression in society. As he says about his art, it is an investigation of ‘the representation of minorities within achievement of history, and within law and social/political structures: how does legalisation/ criminalisation characterize certain social groups and what are the consequences of the heterosexual (regulated) structures?’ (Olesen in http://www.sparwasserhq.de/Index/HTMLmar4/CVhenrikolesen.htm"

      {
       "text": ", accessed 9 March 2009). He particularly directs his interest towards sexual orientation and the socio-cultural prejudice that surrounds it, as well as all the consequent economic and political ramifications of this. His criticism is expressed through subversive conceptual strategies, such as placing material of various origins in a new context.\nOlesen’s work takes many forms, including posters, collage, sculpture and installation. He has exhibited a range of work such as photographs accompanied by texts based on rights-related facts and information drawn from state archives of countries all over the world; carton boxes squeezed against walls; and young tree branches of differing shapes tied in a bundle. His spatial interventions, which reduce the size of architectural elements or block them altogether, symbolise the restrictions imposed by public laws and categorisations in contemporary culture, while his materials are intentionally fragile, questioning the stability of the cultural and legal constructions of society. Untitled is an example of this use of a fragile material – the digital print. Its pinning directly to the wall may furthermore be seen as referring to or paralleling the literal act of pressing someone against the wall, in this way alluding to the psychological pain caused by the criminalisation of a particular sexual orientation.\nFurther reading:\nLars Bang Larsen, ‘Natural Justice’, frieze, issue 70, October 2002, http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/natural_justice/, accessed 9 March 2009.\nHeike Munder (ed.), Henrik Olesen: Some Faggy Gestures, exhibition catalogue, Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst, Zürich 2008.\nHenrik Olesen, What is Authority?, Copenhagen 2002.\nEvi Baniotopoulou\nMarch 2009"

These took the form of paragraphs printed on green paper. In the ‘Inflammatory Essays’ street posters, Holzer offset the texts on as many different colours as the printer could supply.\nIn the 1970s Holzer abandoned her practice as an abstract painter in order to make more explicit statements and to establish more direct contact with a larger audience than would visit galleries. Her art began to appear in the form of texts on posters which were exposed on the streets like fly-posters. In Jeanne Siegel's article and interview with the artist Holzer stated: ‘From the beginning, my work has been designed to be stumbled across in the course of a person's daily life. I think it has the most impact when someone is just walking along, not thinking about anything in particular, and then finds these unusual statements either on a poster or in a sign.’\nThe texts are provocative and their subjects range from the scientific to the political and interpersonal. According to Siegel almost any subject seemed suitable for exposition, with the exception of art which was deliberately avoided. Holzer explained to Siegel as follows:"

      {
       "text": "What I tried to do, starting with the Truisms and then with the other series, was to hit on as many topics as possible. The truism format was good for this since you can concisely make observations on almost any topic. Increasingly I tried to pick hot topics. With the next series ‘Inflammatory Essays’, I wrote about things that were unmentionable or that were the burning question of the day."
      },
      {
       "text": "In contrast to the ‘Inflammatory Essays’ which consist of paragraphs of text, ‘Truisms’ were statements confined to a length of one line which were either displayed together on a poster or broadcast as a continuous light display.\nThe tone of the ‘Inflammatory Essays’ is aggressive and challenging. The texts are the invention of the artist, although they do not necessarily reflect the artist's own views. From one Essay to another they ‘display a spectrum of views, from far-left to far-right. I wanted to talk about things that are very important to people but in a non-didactic way (the series as a whole with its conflicting views is not didactic). I tried to show how dangerous and absurd it is to be a fanatic, but how important it is to get things done’ (letter to the compiler). They often have the air of slogans found in graffiti form on walls in the city.\nIn preparation she read ‘Mao, Lenin, Emma Goldman, various religious and right wing fanatics, miscellaneous American anarchists and some “folk” crackpot literature’. Her intention was to ‘write things that were very hot - in tone and subject matter - to (hopefully) instill a sense of urgency in the reader. I wanted the reader to jump, at least, and maybe consider doing something useful.’ To this end the posters were first ‘wheat-pasted in the streets of Manhattan. They were placed wherever posters normally appear’ but the choice of text was not always arbitrary. ‘Sometimes I'd choose certain texts for certain neighbourhoods. It was fun to put particularly frightening ones uptown.’ Each week Holzer pasted up a different poster. In order to make clear that a new poster was on display she had them printed on paper of different colours and ‘to let the viewers know that the posters were part of a series, I made each poster exactly 100 words long and 20 lines’ (letter to the compiler).\nWhen the posters are displayed in a gallery the artist likes ‘them to be pasted directly on the wall, from floor to ceiling with their edges overlapping slightly so that no wall shows through. It's good to completely cover a wall 10' × 25' in vertical or diagonal stripes of posters’ (letter to the compiler).\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1982-84: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1986"

The words ‘State 11’ in the title refer to the fact that Longo made prints of each of these figures individually before combining them in one image. State 1 is in an edition of 45 each.\nP07899 is related to a drawing entitled ‘Study for Final Life 1982/Untitled 1982’ (repr. Carter Ratcliff, Robert Longo, Munich, 1985, pl.55) and to three untitled drawings, two of 1981 and one of 1982 (repr. ibid., pl.53). These last three drawings preceded the making of the prints.\nLongo's images are deliberately ambiguous suggesting violence, drunkenness, dancing and dying. They are based on photographs which the artist takes but which he then works in such a way that the figures become anonymous. Ratcliff has identified that ‘Longo's contorted men in suits have their origin in an image of assassination - a still from a Rainer Werner Fassbinder film, The American Soldier, which shows a man with his hand drawn to the bullet wound in his violently arching back’ (Ratcliff, p.16). The series of drawings to which P07889 relates is entitled ‘Men in the Cities’.\nEach image in P07889 is embossed in such a way that the figures appear to be separately printed. The figures are drawn by hand.\nThis entry has been approved by the artist.\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1982-84: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1986"

         "text": "P02948 includes a bold example of woodblock printing. The emergence of this technique in Rothenstein's work is discussed in the entry on ‘Tournament’ (P77204). In ‘RIP II’ Rothenstein took an impression in blue ink directly from the surface of an elm wood trunk. The edge of the image is the edge of the actual tree trunk. In contrast, the other elements, all man-made, were printed by photomechanical methods: the drill and drill sections were achieved with line blocks, the sprocket with a half-tone block. The methods of printing used by the artist in P02948 reinforce the idea of the difference between nature and artifice through the mechanical process itself."

        {
         "text": "In conversation on 5 September 1991, Rothenstein told the compiler that in the case of P02948 he asked a friend to photograph the sprocket. The photograph was then made into a zinco. The zinco, or half-tone zinc plate, has dots of varying intensity which create an illusion of tone suitable for the translation of continuous tone images such as photographs. Normally, Rothenstein would take his own photographs and send them to a commercial blockmaker, specifying that the zinco should not be mounted type-high at nine-tenths of an inch, as was usual for traditional presses, since he wished to take impressions from things as ‘thin as paper and thick as great blocks of wood’."

        {
         "text": "The image of wood is the actual size of the tree trunk. The pincers and drills were taken from a toolmaker's catalogue of about 1900 (title unknown). The bringing together of disparate sources such as these excited the artist, because it contradicted the usual critical evaluation of prints based on ‘the beauty of the unity of means’. For the artist it represented the opposite, ‘the beautiful disunity of means’, and it was this that, in his view, gave energy and excitement to the image. Rothenstein was particularly fascinated by the conflict created by the collage element of the work. For him this effect was heightened by the contrast between the broken drill, which seems like a necklace around the base of the trunk, and the larger mass of the wood. The presence of the man-made objects, which may or may not be used as tools, does not in his opinion detract from the fact that the image is essentially about the wood."

         "text": "The title of P02948 pinpoints Rothenstein's intended meaning, which centres around the idea of the violence perpetrated by man-made industry and technology against the natural world. In a letter to the compiler of 18 January 1992 he wrote, ‘For me the main shape was like a waterfall - or a double waterfall. In contrast the shapes of the tools are all edges metallic and confined and are suggested metaphors for cutting or working wood - hence RIP’. In answer to a question he stated in conversation that the word ‘RIP’ had had no connection in his mind with the initials ‘R.I.P.’, signifying ‘Rest in Peace’."

The artist discussed this aspect of his early pictures in an interview for the National Sound Archive (‘Michael Rothenstein Interviewed by Mel Gooding’, National Life Story Collection: Lives of the Artists, British Library National Sound Archive, C466/02, 23–24/7/1990).

Sidey 1993, p.157 no.197), ‘Belfast’, 1973 (repr. ibid., pl.xxxvii in col.), ‘Jags’, 1973 (repr. ibid., p.158 no.210), ‘Violence’, 1973 (repr. ibid., p.159 no.212), ‘Crash’, 1974 (repr. ibid., pl.xxxix in col.), ‘Crunch’, 1974 (repr. ibid., p.160 no.215) and ‘New York City’, 1974 (repr. ibid., pl.xl in col.).

Both this work and its partner (Tate T07600) consist of a restricted palette of red, black, white and grey. Both use unmodulated areas of these non-naturalistic colours, and a stark and spikey mode of representation, to conjure up a sense of isolation and of the uncanny."

        {
         "text": "Here, the red foreground rises steeply to an array of man-made structures: grey stone huts, a water-tower, a signpost presumably marking a former military installation. The starkness of the scene is exaggerated by the compositional emphasis on strong horizontal and vertical lines. The darkened doorways of the austere buildings, and the simplicity of the tower, the sign and the post in the foreground, all suggest a feeling of abandonment. Two enigmatic shapes, perhaps rocks, and the remains of what appear to be palm leaves introduce a certain anxious quality that they share with the contemporaneous work of Lucian Freud. Boswell could have seen the exhibitions in London in 1946 and 1947 in which Freud established an angular and linear style of painting with an air of unease that seemed to speak to the post-war world. If the man-made elements in Untitled (Iraq) may speak of a departed human presence, the decimated leaves seem to suggest past violence - of a storm perhaps, or of war."

        {
         "text": "Having been called up as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1941, Boswell was sent to Iraq in 1942 and returned the following year. By the beginning of the war, he was already established as a painter and illustrator. As a member of the Communist Party and a founder member of the left-wing Artists International Association, his work had been highly political, consisting of satires on the forces of the state and representations of working class cultures. In the army, such themes continued in private, as the artist filled sketchbooks with drawings in which officers are shown with bulls' heads riding on the shoulders of the ordinary, expendable soldiers. After the war he left the Communist Party and his work became less overtly political, as he returned to painting. Untitled (Iraq) might, nevertheless, be seen as a comment on the soldier's life or on an austere and haunted post-war world. While in Iraq, Boswell noted the dreamlike existence he shared with his comrades and his desire 'to eliminate the incidental. To extract the dream reality, to evoke the unreality of the soldier's life' (quoted in Wilson 1999, unpaginated). Similarly, the stark desolation of the scene inevitably suggests the widespread sense of loss and anxiety that succeeded the war and the Holocaust and which characterised the beginning of the nuclear age."

Nauman has connected his word works, involving anagrams, palindromes and mirror images, to his interest in the image reversal that took place when he removed the moulds from his early fibre glass sculptures. The frequently disturbing or ambiguous nature of the semi-concealed messages in the word-works is in contrast to the spare elegance of the images. Here the message discovered within the letters is the brutal phrase 'Rape Me'."

In the period 1967–79 Abrahams focused on garden imagery, exploring the relationship between art, artifice and nature. Many of the images used in early prints were based on small, relatively poor quality photographs of gardens reproduced in gardening magazines, such as the weekly Amateur Gardening and Popular Gardening, or, less frequently, better quality illustrations found in the series of volumes on gardens published by Country Life in the 1920s. This use of second-hand source material gives much of his printed output a conceptual quality, and links his work to Pop art. Abrahams has presented a large amount of source material relating to his printmaking of this period, including magazine clippings, photographs and sketches and acetate stencils, to the Tate Gallery Archive (TGA 8315)."

The dealer Bernard Jacobson published many of his portfolios, and the Mayor Gallery organised a series of touring shows of prints and sculptures. In this period Abrahams was based in London, working at a studio in Leonard Street, EC2, from 1969 to 1982, and at the A & A Foundry in Bow from 1982 to 1992, with a second studio at Butler's Wharf from 1974 to 1979."

In 1988 they bought a house in the small village, Castelnau de Guers, in the same region, and have lived there on a full-time basis since 1992."

Regarding Burke's views on pain and pleasure, Lynton (1978,[p.3]) wrote:"

Beauty he almost denounces. It shows man as a social animal, determining his sexual focus, shaping his physical environment; it has the virtues but also the limitations of civilization. The sublime (and here Burke emphatically speaks of a human response, not of something possibly inherent in objects) reveals nature in man, and that also means the divine in man. Beauty goes with polish and politeness, with moderation and neatness, and thus with utility; the sublime is not a grander form of beauty, as had been proposed before Burke, but signifies an experience of quite another kind, associated with qualities that have nothing to do with the world of reason and order. Vastness is sublime, darkness is sublime; the ungraspable, the unknowable, immeasurable, infinitely awesome is sublime. Faced by enormous mountain ranges, craggy and threatening, or by tempestuous oceans, or endless and formless deserts, man experiences fear and pain but also, if he will but allow his appetite to speak, the sublime - and that means a sensation of joy more poignant than anything the reassuring effects of beauty and order can provide."

Walpole said of William Kent, the painter and designer, that he had shown that ‘all nature was a garden’. Burke showed that outside the nature we adopt as a garden lies a nature that attracts us much more forcibly by refusing to be a garden, and that man's own nature is not garden-like but an imperious wilderness where darkness means not evil but elemental power and where the mysterious and the incomprehensible is true wisdom. It is not just that Burke points beyond Romanticism to Symbolism and to Surrealism, and out of the classical frameword [sic] towards exoticism, primitivism and abstraction. He announces an aesthetic response that is natural to man, not educated, let alone scholarly, but inherent in man the animal, with bodily needs and warning systems, and in man the possessor of a soul, capable of intimations of immortality-in other words, Everyman (or even every child)."

The translation of half-tone images by means of colour could be one of the most decisive steps, but equally so in some cases was the imposition of graphic marks on finely gradated photographs. At times it could seem that Burke's words contributed directly to the working process, with ‘power’, ‘pain’, ‘pleasure’ and so on, characterizing the means whereby the final image was reached. For the bystander it could all be very disconcerting, as he watched attractive source material being chopped and changed and taking on a new guise in taking on a new role - a new role, I suspect, only for the bystander: in Abrahams' mind the association may long have existed, so that the process was one of finding the required image within the selection material, like finding a marble figure within the block. (Abrahams' physical activity in preparing his prints - cutting out, reducing, adding, bringing forward, putting together - was itself sculptural, and suggests that print making may be more naturally a sculptor's activity than a painter's.)"

The artist, he wrote, ‘has been tempted by the non-descriptive passages, even by reverberations between sentences, by the flux of feeling and images as one reads the book that floods the mind without immediate relevance to the surface of Burke's arguments’ (ibid., [p.1]). Although many of the images are hard to decipher, they are all based on figurative sources. For Lynton, the suite signified a major turning point in Abrahams' work, a return to the figured sources of the artist's very earliest sculptures. Whereas the garden-based works addressed the human condition metaphorically, and with an element of parody, Abrahams used here ‘imagery with which we identify closely’. ‘In short, then’, Lynton concluded (ibid., [p.7]),"

         "text": "I note a diminution of black humour, of satire, of humanity placed harshly before the magnifying mirror of Abrahams' art. Instead I see images of suffering that are also images of dignity, images that are dramatic and invite empathy without throwing sympathy back at us, images where the awful and the terrible does indeed, without false rhetoric, take on sublimity."

Both portfolios had taken a great deal of time to prepare, and marked in his view an important step towards his later figure-based works. While the Poe images had been inspired directly by particular texts, Abrahams had felt freer with the Burke suite to let his imagination work on the photographic source material. Lynton (ibid., [p.5]) wrote about the relationship of the two portfolios: ‘In moving on from the quasi-religious transcendental fiction of the American Romantic to the more earth-bound prose of the Irishman, in whom waking experience of the real world produced much the same exhilaration and wonderment as dream and perhaps drugs produced in Poe, Abrahams has moved closer to the true springs of creative magic.’"

The head and front legs of the dog remain recognisable, but the rest of the body, which is black, blue and green in colour, is treated abstractly. The ground is yellow and grey, and there is an irregular border of dark grey at the bottom of the image. Although not specifically tied to any one of the Burke texts accompanying suite, the subject of P11176 evokes the theme of the excerpt titled ‘The cries of ANIMALS’."

         "text": "Although Martin Disler had had some experience of etching prior to making this portfolio, he had never before worked on a large scale. In this portfolio he embraces a wide variety of etching techniques, some of which he had never previously used, and explores the possibilities of the medium. He employs aquatint, soft and hard ground, sugar lift, drypoint and photo-etching. Disler's paintings are gestural and improvisatory and his printmaking techniques reflect this approach; for example in one print he literally pressed his hand into the soft ground."
        },
        {
         "text": "Disler has a preference for working at night but was unable to etch at night because the workshop facilities were not available. He therefore made a series of drawings and poems at night time which would put him in the mood for working on plates in the morning. Although the prints do not exactly resemble any particular drawings they are close to them in spirit. Disler has said of his method of working:"

         "text": "Manhattan seemed to me well suited for hanging out far above the rim of the world in order to see more sharply than ever what was going on in people's faces and in the streets. Every morning at 11.00 a.m, I went up to the fifth floor in Lafayette Street. Waiting for me there was Paul Marcus, a printer who grew up in the Bronx and is incredibly experienced in the techniques of the trade. I had been drawing with charcoal and lithographic crayons all night, and I spoke with Paul about the drawings and how they might best be realized. In reality, I was fully determined to work in such a manner that it is impossible to recognize at a glance whether etching is the medium used. I noticed the staff's extremely orthodox attitude toward their craft, and knew I would not have an easy time. While I was smearing ‘soft ground’ (vernismou) with my finger onto the copper plate and looking deep into my picture through the mirror image, I actually got the impression that Pat, the supervisor at the printer's, would pass out. By the second copy, though, she found it ‘magical’, and Paul and I understood each other so well that I got the feeling that the etchings, although derived from my drawings, made at night, increasingly grew out of the conversation with him. The atmosphere was extremely tense because, on the one hand, Paul's preparations of the plate and tools proceeded slowly and ritualistically, and I, on the other hand, attacked the plates quickly and decisively. I had become aggressive from waiting, and as a consequence the tools often broke. We were determined to use every technique. Paul and I noticed how the etchings became several dimensions deeper than the drawings, and we smiled at each other (quoted by Curiger, pp.117–18)."
        },
        {
         "text": "The eight parts do not form a sequence or a narrative but are separate images and are accompanied by a cassette tape on which Disler recites a text entitled ‘Nigger-Joint Cabaret’. The text was written at night and provides a link between the night time activities and the daytime etching, although it was not conceived specifically as an accompaniment. It incorporates the title of the portfolio and relates, ‘the Story of Mr Feels Like a Million’, who is a black dog, and makes reference to New York life. Like the drawings and the etchings it has an automatic quality and is not a straightforward narrative. Images of violence and sexuality pervade the text and relate perhaps to the inclusion of the knife. In addition certain images within it appear to relate directly to the etchings."
        },
        {
         "text": "Disler considers etching to be an important aspect of his work. He has stated in conversation with the compiler that he regards it as ‘alchemy to make a drawing on a plate and you do not know what is coming up’. He particularly likes the richness of black which can be achieved in printing."

           "text": "Although Martin Disler had had some experience of etching prior to making this portfolio, he had never before worked on a large scale. In this portfolio he embraces a wide variety of etching techniques, some of which he had never previously used, and explores the possibilities of the medium. He employs aquatint, soft and hard ground, sugar lift, drypoint and photo-etching. Disler's paintings are gestural and improvisatory and his printmaking techniques reflect this approach; for example in one print he literally pressed his hand into the soft ground."

He therefore made a series of drawings and poems at night time which would put him in the mood for working on plates in the morning. Although the prints do not exactly resemble any particular drawings they are close to them in spirit. Disler has said of his method of working:"

           "text": "Manhattan seemed to me well suited for hanging out far above the rim of the world in order to see more sharply than ever what was going on in people's faces and in the streets. Every morning at 11.00 a.m, I went up to the fifth floor in Lafayette Street. Waiting for me there was Paul Marcus, a printer who grew up in the Bronx and is incredibly experienced in the techniques of the trade. I had been drawing with charcoal and lithographic crayons all night, and I spoke with Paul about the drawings and how they might best be realized. In reality, I was fully determined to work in such a manner that it is impossible to recognize at a glance whether etching is the medium used. I noticed the staff's extremely orthodox attitude toward their craft, and knew I would not have an easy time. While I was smearing ‘soft ground’ (vernismou) with my finger onto the copper plate and looking deep into my picture through the mirror image, I actually got the impression that Pat, the supervisor at the printer's, would pass out. By the second copy, though, she found it ‘magical’, and Paul and I understood each other so well that I got the feeling that the etchings, although derived from my drawings, made at night, increasingly grew out of the conversation with him. The atmosphere was extremely tense because, on the one hand, Paul's preparations of the plate and tools proceeded slowly and ritualistically, and I, on the other hand, attacked the plates quickly and decisively. I had become aggressive from waiting, and as a consequence the tools often broke. We were determined to use every technique. Paul and I noticed how the etchings became several dimensions deeper than the drawings, and we smiled at each other (quoted by Curiger, pp.117–18)."

           "text": "The eight parts do not form a sequence or a narrative but are separate images and are accompanied by a cassette tape on which Disler recites a text entitled ‘Nigger-Joint Cabaret’. The text was written at night and provides a link between the night time activities and the daytime etching, although it was not conceived specifically as an accompaniment. It incorporates the title of the portfolio and relates, ‘the Story of Mr Feels Like a Million’, who is a black dog, and makes reference to New York life. Like the drawings and the etchings it has an automatic quality and is not a straightforward narrative. Images of violence and sexuality pervade the text and relate perhaps to the inclusion of the knife. In addition certain images within it appear to relate directly to the etchings."

All but two of the drawings seem to be of Pembrokeshire themes; some were probably made in preparation for this exhibition, others during further visits to Pembrokeshire in August and September - October that year. They include sketches of the hill known as Carnllidi which later served as the basis for his painting 'Red Landscape' of 1942. They are among the last Pembrokeshire studies made before he began to devote most of his time to work as an Official War Artist."

Marie Seton writes of a rapprochement between Nehru's sister and herself and mentions this sister's loyalty to Paul and Essie (Paul Robeson and his wife Essie). Seton describes family in-fighting and her fears that this sister is putting pressure on Nehru regarding Menon whom she hates. Seton writes about Menon's relationship with Nehru and Dr Allchin's advice that Menon have psychiatric treatment. She tells Ronald that she has had a word with the detective guarding Nehru to keep an eye on Menon in case of any threat of violence or efforts to frame him. The letter concludes with a description of a baby elephant given as a present to Nehru, fears about the unhappiness of Indira's younger son, and news of Paul and Essie Robeson's illnesses."

She then describes a short 'fantasia' novella she has sent off for a Horizon. Seton refers to cuttings relating to the Henry Wallace campaign and the opposition to it in America. She also comments on the spirit of America and her fears that 'America is now only one step away from out and out Fascism'. She then reflects on the prospect of her and Donald's [Hesson, her then husband] prospect of political martyrdom if they remain in America.\nContinued 2 Sep 1948\nThe second part of the letter describes the violence committed against a Wallace party candidate, Curtiss MacDougall. Seton also mentions a ruling made against the Third Party and her involvement in the Third Party campaign. She informs Moody that Donald is standing for Attorney General in Illinois and gives her thoughts on America as a melting pot and the impact this has on politics.\nA p.s. at the end of the letter gives further details about the Third Party and Wallace and Seton's friendship with Paul [Robeson]."
