     "text": "The central rotund shape in this painting derives from a photograph of a Sudanese corn-bin, which Ernst has transformed into a sinister mechanical monster. Ernst often re-used found images, and either added or removed elements in order to create new realities, all the more disturbing for being drawn from the known world. The work’s title comes from a childish German rhyme that begins: ‘The elephant from Celebes has sticky, yellow bottom grease’. The painting’s inexplicable combinations, such as the headless female figure and the elephant-like creature, suggest images from a dream and the Freudian technique of free association."

     "text": "'Celebes', or 'The Elephant Celebes' as it is sometimes known, was painted in Cologne in 1921 and was Max Ernst's first large picture. It was bought shortly after its completion by his friend the poet Paul Eluard and later passed from him to Sir Roland Penrose, who owned it until 1975 when he gave it to be sold for the benefit of the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Sir Roland's Charlton Lecture, op. cit., is by far the most detailed study of it and is the basis of the following note. The reader is referred to it for a detailed compositional analysis and interpretation."

     "text": "The boiler-like monster to which the title refers is, like the rest of the painting, highly ambiguous. It has a horned head with apparently sightless eyes, but a pair of tusks projecting on the left suggests the possible presence of a second head (or perhaps the real head?) on the other side. Its neck seems to consist of a long snake-like coil which emerges from a hole in its upper section; the top is surmounted by a brightly-coloured construction containing a mysterious eye. It seems to be standing in a large open space, but there are also indications that it is embedded in a solid background, while two fishes swim in the sky above. Three upright objects stand around it, while in the bottom corner a headless mannequin figure with a raised arm appears to be beckoning the monster towards it."

     "text": "As was first noted by John Craxton and subsequently confirmed by Ernst himself, the image of the boiler-like form on its pair of 'legs' was originally inspired by an illustration in an English anthropological journal of a huge communal corn-bin peculiar to the Konkombwa tribe of the southern Sudan. The photograph is taken from the same angle and is basically very similar, but the artist has given the hollow clay container a metallic appearance and changed its character completely by adding the various appendages described above."

     "text": "Bear (10 minutes, 35 seconds) was Steve McQueen's first major film. Although not an overtly political work, for many viewers it raises sensitive issues about race, homoeroticism and violence. It depicts two naked men-one of whom is the artist-tussling and teasing one another in an encounter which shifts between tenderness and aggression. The film is silent but a series of stares, glances and winks between the protagonists creates an optical language of flirtation and threat."
    },
    {
     "text": "In defiance of cinematic convention, the film opens with a close-up shot of one man's shoulder. The camera then moves slowly upwards and to the right, traversing his face with a proximity that suggests it is almost feeling its way across the contours of his skin. After less than a minute, the slow rhythm of this opening shot is interrupted by a dynamic scene of sparring between the two men. Throughout the film, the disorientating camerawork and silent movement of the two bodies moving across a shaft of light, adds to the existing sense of ambiguity. Light sometimes dances off the reflective sweat on their skin, sometimes throws them into shadow and sometimes momentarily blinds the viewer when its full glare is uninterrupted. At certain moments, close-up shots from underneath the men's two interlocked bodies tend towards abstraction with swinging genitalia the only markers for orientation amid a confusion of limbs. Near the end of the film, a back-edited sequence of feet circling around the camera, taunting and dodging each another, recalls the fragmented movement of Eadweard Muybridge's nineteenth century locomotion photographs. This scene can be particularly related to the interest in early cinema which has informed much of McQueen's work."
    },
    {
     "text": "Like all McQueen's early films, Bear is black and white. It was shot on 16mm film but has been transferred to video and is installed floor to ceiling across one wall in a black room. The floor of this room is highly polished so that a reflection of the image falls across it and the viewer is unable to stand outside its presence. McQueen's strategy of displaying the work in an enclosed space and on a scale above human proportions has important implications: 'You are very much involved in what's going on. You are a participant not a passive viewer,' he has explained (Bickers, p.2). In addition, the silence of Bear is intended to be disconcerting: 'The whole idea of making it a silent piece is so that when people walk into the space they become very much aware of themselves, of their own breathing,' McQueen has commented. 'I want to put people into a situation where they're sensitive to themselves watching the piece' (Bickers, p.2)."

The startlingly violent image of three interlocking figures was derived from a lost work by the Mexican painter José Clemente Orozco showing the fraternal struggle between Cain and Abel. Pollock’s exploration of the theme may reflect his interest in the archetypal myths explored in Jungian psychoanalysis. The subject may also refer to the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War, which engulfed Europe as America looked on with horror."

Its composition appears to show three naked male figures: the man on the right is attempting to strike the others with a knife and is being fought off by the man in the centre, while the third man on the left is crouching in terror, with his arms raised in protection. The forms are closely packed and interlocking, with violent, angular clashes of movement, and dramatic contrasts of light and shade.\nIn his article in Artforum, O'Connor stresses the influence of Orozco on Pollock's work at this period and suggests that this picture (as well as showing Orozco's stylistic influence) utilizes figure motifs borrowed from Orozco's frescoes at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, painted in 1932–4. The similarity seems to be mainly between the two left-hand figures and several of the figures on the left of Orozco's panel ‘The Departure of Quetzalcoatl’, though the resemblance is not close enough to be conclusive. The fact that there is little or no sign of the influence of Picasso and Miró, whose influence began to displace Orozco's from 1940–41 onwards, would suggest that its date can probably be narrowed down to the period 1938–40.\nWhereas Orozco's paintings have dramatic subjects based on historical or mythological events, the drama in this picture by Pollock seems to be purely subjective in origin.\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1980-82: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1984"

    {
     "text": "Sabra and Shatila Massacre 1982–3 is a monumental work in ball point pen and pencil on paper, constructed in six sections and affixed to canvas for support. The work was made in response to the massacre by Christian Lebanese Phalangists of Palestinian refugees in the camps in Beirut, Lebanon, between 16 and 18 September 1982, while the camps were under the guard of the Israeli Defence Force. Working from imagination, al-Azzawi has delineated the scenes of chaos and horror in the Sabra and Shatila camps in a semi-abstract style, with a shallow perspective."
    },
    {
     "text": "Speaking with Tate curator Jessica Morgan on 27 April 2011, the artist explained that his decision to depict the scenes of the massacre was inspired by reading the essay Quatre Heures à Chatila (Four Hours in Shatila) by French writer Jean Genet (1910–1986). Genet was in Beirut when the massacres took place and was one of the first observers to enter the camps thereafter. He wrote: ‘A photograph doesn’t show the flies nor the thick white smell of death. Neither does it show how you must jump over the bodies as you walk along from one corpse to the next … A barbaric party had taken place there.’ (Jean Genet, ‘Quatre heures à Chatila’, Revue d’études palestiniennes, vol.6, Winter 1983, pp.3–19.) Al-Azzawi explained that the drawing was made in his home in Highgate, London, over a number of months, during which time he worked solely on this project. Stylistically it owes a debt to Pablo Picasso’s Guernica 1937 (Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid), although al-Azzawi’s drawing is considerably more claustrophobic; the vast expanse of paper offers no respite from the horror of the scene, being densely packed with body parts, architectural and domestic details, images of animals and bombs."
    },
    {
     "text": "Markedly different to al-Azzawi’s normally colourful paintings and relief sculptures from this time, the use of mainly black and grey tones in Sabra and Shatila Massacre is interrupted by moments of colour used to depict the earthy tones of the ground or the red of blood. This restrained use of colour makes its appearance all the more jarring in the massive expanse of the drawing. The style of this work relates more closely to the print and book illustrations by the artist, practices that have consistently been major parts of his output. In 1976 al-Azzawi made a series of drawings for a book about the destruction and loss of life at the Tel al-Zaatar Palestinian refugee camp in that year, similarly calling on literature to mediate the violence of the event. On his use of literature, and in particular poetry, as a catalyst for his work al-Azzawi has said: ‘The poem is very important. It gives the artist a great deal in terms of atmosphere. I wanted to paint the tragedy of Tel al-Zaatar. I started, but later I turned to the poems, they gave me the inspiration I needed.’ (Quoted in http://www.azzawiart.com/essays_by_dia.php?id=4, accessed 1 August 2011.) Al-Azzawi has also produced illustrations to accompany collections of Arab poetry (‘Hymne de corps’ 1979, for example), that share the same stark visual language and predominant use of black and grey tones as Sabra and Shatila Massacre. Al-Azzawi’s work has consistently addresed the political events of the Middle East and previous series of works have included over forty gouaches from the 1970s reflecting on his military service fighting the Kurds. Sabra and Shatila Massacre represents the most significant and monumental attempt by the artist to address the turmoil in the region."
    },
    {
     "text": "Dia al-Azzawi was born in 1939 in Baghdad, Iraq. He is considered one of Iraq’s most influential living artists and a leading figure for the emergence of modern painting and printmaking in the country. In 1969 he wrote and published the manifesto ‘Towards the New Vision’, outlining the ambitions of himself and his contemporaries who were incorporating a semi-abstract language in works that drew on a Sumerian, Syrian and Islamic heritage. In the early 1970s, with Shaker Hassan a-Said (1925–2004) and Rafa al-Nasiri (born 1940), he established what became known as the One Dimension group which promoted the idea of an Iraqi or Arab identity through art and the use of calligraphy in modern painting."

    {
     "text": "Due to the scale of Sabra and Shatila Massacre, it has rarely been exhibited, aside from three years between 1983 and 1986 when it was on display at the National Council for Art and Culture, Kuwait. Given its significance in al-Azzawi’s work, however, it has been widely reproduced in catalogues devoted to his work and modern Arab art."

The violence was carried out by a militia associated with a Christian Lebanese right-wing party. The camps were under the guard of the Israeli Defence Force. Al-Azzawi worked on the drawings over several months, creating no other work. In its subject matter and scale, the work is related to Pablo Picasso’s Guernica 1937, a large painting that brought attention to the violence of the Spanish Civil War (1936–9)."

The clouds in the light blue sky are illuminated in pinks, oranges and purples as if at sunset or sunrise. Painted on top of this landscape is the seemingly unrelated phrase ‘THE MUSIC FROM THE BALCONIES NEARBY WAS OVERLAID BY THE NOISE OF SPORADIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE’ in a clean, modern font that is evenly spaced. This work belongs to a large body of paintings, begun in the 1980s, in which the artist Edward Ruscha overlaid landscapes with texts (see Pay Nothing Until April 2003, Tate AR00047, and Daily Planet 2003, Tate AR00048)."
    },
    {
     "text": "Unlike more recent examples of this type of composition, such as Pay Nothing Until April and Daily Planet which use acrylics, The Music from the Balconies is executed in oils. As a result the artist’s process of making the work is more visible in this painting than similar works produced in later decades. The text was applied using stencils and is presented in Boy Scout Utility Modern, a unique typeface created by the artist as a sort of ‘no-style’ (Richards 2008, p.82)."
    },
    {
     "text": "The Music from the Balconies is testament to Ruscha’s friendship with the writer J.G. Ballard. Throughout their respective careers the pair shared a common aesthetic sensibility concerned with the deleterious effects of contemporary life. The text presented in this painting is lifted from Ballard’s 1975 novel High-Rise, which charts the moral and social breakdown of an ultra-modern, residential tower block. Ruscha has described this painting as an ‘illustration’ of some of the novel’s themes and ideas (artist’s talk, Wolverhampton Art Gallery, 21 October 2011). While not directly representing the urban setting in High-Rise, Ruscha’s painting offers an intriguing visual analogue for some of the psychological tensions that underpin the novel. The jarring juxtaposition of pastoral imagery and rationally-designed typeface reflect the conflict between man and nature that unravels throughout Ballard’s novel. While the exaggerated palette of Ruscha’s landscape causes it to appear artificially simulated or chemically induced, which might also be seen as reflecting the interests of Ballard, who frequently explored the themes of drugs and advanced technology in his writings."
    },
    {
     "text": "The landscape represented in The Music from the Balconies appears to be inspired by the prairie landscapes of Ruscha’s childhood home of Oklahoma, although it could equally reflect the coastal prairies of California, his adopted home for many years. Seen in this light the prairie setting connects with the landscape tradition in American art and the wide-open vistas found in many of Ruscha’s paintings and photographic works dating back to the early years of his career. Likewise the saturated colours also recall the Technicolor film stock perfected during Hollywood’s golden age, highlighting Ruscha’s long-term interest in film and the Hollywood film industry, whose studios are located close to Ruscha’s own artistic studio."

     "text": "Boris Taslitzky made Riposte in direct response to current events. In the aftermath of the Second World War (1939-45), France fought to suppress claims for independence in its colonies in Indo-China which had just been freed from Japanese occupation. Supplies and troops were shipped from French ports, which became the focus for unrest. In 1949 the dockers of Port-de-Bouc, near Marseille, refused to load the ships and staged a strike which was broken up by armed police. The violence of this official action appalled Taslitzky, as the use of police dogs against French citizens raised memories of Nazi wartime atrocities. Drawing accounts from newspapers, he set out to encapsulate the conflict. He dramatised his image through sharpened colour and a spatial concentration created by the lighting and the pattern of the cobblestones. The details are deliberately emotive. At the centre a dog bites into the arm of a collapsing woman. The darkly uniformed police are largely faceless, with the exception of one held down in the foreground who resembles the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler (1889-1945). By contrast, the dockers are dressed in light colours, and they launch their 'riposte' using the available bricks. A woman seizes the French tricolore flag, symbol of the revolutionary ideals of 'Liberty, Fraternity and Equality', so that, by implication, she represents the true nature of French sympathies."
    },
    {
     "text": "In style, subject and scale Riposte demonstrates Taslitzky's admiration for the great nineteenth century painters Francisco Goya (1746-1828), Théodore Géricault (1791-1824) and Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863). The characterisation recalls the victims of execution in Goya's Fourth of May, 1814 (Prado, Madrid), while the woman with the flag echoes Delacroix's Liberty at the Barricades, 1834 (Louvre, Paris). Taslitzky's commitment to political art derived from the Communist Party's doctrine of Socialist Realism, which was first proposed in the early 1930s as a contemporary realism legible to the vast majority, for whom avant-garde art was considered abstruse. Taslitzky first emerged as a key practitioner of French Socialist Realism in the 1930s, as shown by his The Strikes of June 1936 (T07404). He resumed his social criticism on his return in 1945 from wartime imprisonment in the concentration camp at Buchenwald, where he had been interned as a communist by the Nazis."
    },
    {
     "text": "The strength of Taslitzky's work is demonstrated in the reception of Riposte when, in 1951, it reached the Salon d'Automne, which had already been the site of political controversy in the preceding years. Although hung by the committee, Riposte was among seven works protesting against the war in Indo-China (including a portrait submitted by Taslitzky under a pseudonym) that were removed by police as an 'offence to national feeling'. This was in preparation for the visit by the President of the Republic, Vincent Auriol (1884-1966, President 1947-54), and attracted a storm of publicity, ranging from the issue of censorship to the questionable legality of the action. The re-instatement and the removal again of some of the works - not including Taslitzky's - only served to prolong the authorities' difficulties. The prominent communist intellectual Louis Aragon (1897-1982) wrote a coruscating article, entitled 'At the Salon d'Automne: Painting has Ceased to be a Game'. He revealed that the arts Minister Baylot, who was responsible for the removals, had previously been the Prefect for the area of Port-de-Bouc at the time of the strikes."

One policeman resembles Hitler - an especially powerful device for an artist who had been imprisoned by the Nazis. A woman striker seizes the French tricolore, symbol of the Revolutionary ideals. Government ministers were so sensitive to the painting that they ordered its removal from an exhibition in 1951."

     "text": "The support for Riposte was prepared by the artist. The work was painted on one piece of sized, linen canvas with a fine threads and a close weave. A thin layer of off-white oil priming was applied over the linen surface. The canvas was then stretched over a heavy wooden stretcher with one horizontal crossbar and two vertical crossbars. The joints were expandable with squared mortise and tenon joints. The flat front profile of the stretcher bars contributed to the development of stretcher cracks on the front face of the painting. There was a small tear in the canvas, with raised and crackled paint, located at 700 mm left and 105 mm bottom.\nThin black lines visible around the paint indicate that the major design elements were first sketched on the priming, using an undetermined material. Taslitzky initially worked out his compositions for his large paintings in oil paint on artist board. The colour oil sketch for this work is currently displayed on the wall of the artist's studio in Paris.\nThe first layer of paint is thinly applied, almost scumbled over the surface. The priming is not exposed but the paint is so thin and transparent in some areas that the colour of the priming has a significant effect on the appearance of the painting. The canvas weave is visible in large areas of the background but, due to its fine threads and close weave, the texture is not a significant design factor.\nSubsequent layers of paint are brushed on thinly. There is little mixing of paint on the canvas, although the paint has been applied wet in wet in several areas. The brushwork is gestural with application in broad strokes of colour. Colours are layered thinly to suggest modelling and give depth to the surface. Some brush strokes are visible but the texture is generally smooth.\nThe surface was coated with a thick layer of glossy, natural resin varnish. It was applied unevenly, resulting in a few drips down the front and varying thickness. The resin has yellowed obscuring the paint surface.\nThe original frame was a wooden strip nailed to the outer edges of the painting.\nThe structure of the painting was in good condition upon acquisition but it required major treatment in order to make it displayable in a gallery. The work was coated with mud, dirt and mould from a previous exposure to water. There are some alligator cracks exposing the underlayers of paint or priming. In the paint film there are large areas of wrinkled paint that occurred due to an oil-rich paint consistency and areas of drying crackle. The stretcher was also contributing to the cracking of the paint.\nThe yellowed varnish interfered with the legibility of the image.\nThe painting was treated in 2002 in the Conservation Department at the Tate. The old stretcher was replaced with a new, expandable wooden stretcher. The mould and dirt were carefully removed. The varnish was cleaned from the surface. The tear was repaired and small scuffs and losses to the paint surface were retouched. A new varnish coat of Paraloid B72 was applied to the surface. The painting was installed in a new wooden frame. The painting is now in very good condition for display.\nPatricia Smithen\nAugust, 2001"

This example in lead is one of an edition of four bronze and two lead casts. It is inscribed 'Fautrier' and '3/6' and is stamped with the Valsuani mark, the foundry used by Fautrier for casting the majority of his sculptures. It is believed that the edition was completed before the artist's death in 1964. The other lead cast is in the collection of the Musée de l'Ile de France, Château de Sceaux, Sceaux."

     "text": "Fautrier was part of a Resistance circle of writers, poets, and artists in Paris during World War II. In January 1943 he was arrested by the Nazis because of this affiliation. He was released upon the intervention of the German sculptor Arno Breker and withdrew to Châtenay-Malabray, a mental asylum in the suburbs of Paris. The writer Jean Paulhan arranged for him to have a studio space in the sanatorium and, while there, Fautrier produced his most famous series of paintings and sculptures, known collectively as the Hostages ('Otages'). The Nazis used the forest surrounding the clinic to torture and execute prisoners and, although their actions were out of sight, the screams of the victims could be heard by those in residence. This harrowing experience is reflected in Fautrier's works. The manipulation of the material of Head of a Hostage, with its layered and scored surfaces, lends the appearance of mutilated flesh to the truncated form. Despite this apparent formlessness, a delicate profile is drawn out of the mass, just as occurs in a number of the paintings of the series. In this way, Fautrier combined elements of figuration and abstraction, conveying both the individuality of the hostages and the amorphous quality of anonymous bodies found in mass graves."
    },
    {
     "text": "The Hostage series was first exhibited at the Galerie René Drouin, Paris, in 1945. The paintings were hung closely in rows, an arrangement which suggested an association with mass executions. The stark portrayal of recent horrors, and the works' combination of beauty and aggression, made viewers uncomfortable. The poet Francis Ponge described the Hostages as 'tumified faces, crushed profiles, bodies stiffened by execution, dismembered, mutilated, eaten by flies' (quoted in Paris Post War, p.89). André Malraux, the politician, critic and writer, in his essay for the exhibition catalogue, traced a link between the sculptures and the paintings. He singled out Head of a Hostage as central to the series: 'The Hostage which is the key to all the others is the large hostage sculpture. Rather than coming from Fautrier's paintings, these figures come from his sculpture. From his sculpture which has found, through torture, what it had sought for a long time in vain: a means of incarnation.' Such a view was redemptive and Malraux went on to claim that Fautrier had created in his Hostages series 'the most beautiful monument to the dead of the Second World War' (quoted in Jean Fautrier, p.222).\nFurther reading:\nAftermath: France 1945-54, exhibition catalogue, Barbican Centre for the Arts, London 1982, pp.49-53\nJean Fautrier 1898-1964, exhibition catalogue, Musée d'art moderne de la ville de Paris 1989, reproduced p.164\nParis Post War: Art and Existentialism 1945-55, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1993, pp.89-103, reproduced p.94 in colour"

     "text": "Jean Fautrier produced twenty-two sculptures in the period between 1927 and 1944, all were based on the human figure. During 1940-4 he concentrated on a series of heads, of which Large Tragic Head is the penultimate and Head of a Hostage (Tate T07300) is the last. In each the head has been the site of a seemingly brutal attack, made all the more expressive by the evidence of the artist's physical manipulation of the material. Large Tragic Head, with its clawed and battered face, is a particularly potent example of Fautrier's work and led to his Hostage series of paintings and sculptures of 1943-5. All of these works were made under the threatening conditions of the German wartime occupation of Paris, where Fautrier was briefly arrested in early 1943. When his works were exhibited after the Liberation, they were seen to memorialise that collective experience. In 1945 André Malraux, the critic, writer and politician, wrote the catalogue introduction to the exhibition of the Hostage series. Though Large Tragic Head anticipates the series, it fits Malraux's description of them as 'the first attempt to dissect contemporary pain, down to its tragic ideograms, and force it into the world of eternity' (quoted in Paris Post War, p.89)."
    },
    {
     "text": "For Fautrier, art had to begin with reality. 'In matters of art', he said, 'all that comes from reality, on condition that it serves only as the initial thrust, appears more imaginative, more magic than anything which obstinately turns its back on it' (quoted in Jean Yves-Mock, 'Jean Fautrier', Apollo, vol.68, September 1958, p.83). This reflects Fautrier's overriding concern with the human condition. During the war he became acutely aware of the bleakness and potency of isolation, a state which 'offers us the purest and the most absolute solutions' (quoted in Paris Post War, p.90). Malraux described the response to wartime suffering found in Fautrier's works as an attempt 'to express the drama without representing it' (quoted in Aftermath, p.50). This may be felt in the balance between the striated part of Large Tragic Head and the delicate modelling of the remaining eye and gasping mouth. That Fautrier stopped short of completely obliterating the features - a tendency he pushed further in Head of a Hostage (Tate T07300) - suggests a desire to commemorate the victims of violence, while making that violence more pronounced."

     "text": "Untitled No. 8 (Shattered Glass) is a large collage of black and white photographs adhered to paper and mounted on board. The photographs show details of diversely textured and patterned urban surfaces, principally grids of wire mesh and details of shards of glass. Henderson has over-painted parts of the photographs in black ink to create an effect of splintering. This assemblage of large and mismatched photographs and brush-applied ink markings collectively creates an abstract pattern that evokes the fragmented surface of broken glass. The work was unglazed when acquired by Tate, and it was probably intended that it remain unglazed because of the subject matter.\nThis work unites the artist’s long-standing interest in the medium of collage with a fascination with the visual effects suggested by fragmented urban textures and surfaces. Henderson began experimenting with collage in the late 1930s, when he worked at the National Gallery as an assistant to the picture restorer Helmut Ruhemann. He returned to this medium after the war, around the time of the end of his studies at the Slade School of Art, where he was a student from 1945-9. At the Slade he had become close friends with fellow student Eduardo Paolozzi (1924-2005), who began working in collage from the mid 1940s. Later, Henderson and Paolozzi collaborated on Untitled (Study for Parallel of Life and Art) 1952 (T12444), a photocollage conceived during the planning of the exhibition Parallel of Life and Art, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1953, which they were both involved in curating. Henderson’s small Collage (T01915) of 1949 is a precursor to Untitled No. 8 (Shattered Glass). In the earlier work, the artist combined collage with oil paint to create a raw assemblage of textures in an abstract design suggestive of the urban environment.\nHenderson took up photography in the late 1940s, drawing on London’s East End where he lived for his subject matter. His attention was directed towards everyday street scenes, in which he identified diverse urban patterns and textures as found objects. In Chisenhale Road 1951 (P79313), Henderson uses a prosaic scene of children’s play to explore the abstracted patterns that emerge from the layering effects of distorted shadow on the etched markings of a hopscotch grid on the road’s surface. In other works, including Bag-wash 1949-53 (P79305), the artist focuses specifically on details of urban decay: weathered windows, torn signage, scratched and broken surfaces. With Untitled No. 8 (Shattered Glass), dating from 1959, Henderson rejects figuration and moves entirely to abstraction. It is thought that this work was exhibited in his solo exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1961 (listed in the catalogue as Big Photo Collage, Shattered Glass.\nUntitled No. 8 (Shattered Glass) refers to the Brutalist aesthetic that permeated Henderson’s work in the 1950s. Reflecting in 1978 on this period, he noted affinities between his art and the work of the French artist Jean Dubuffet (1901–85) (Nigel Henderson: Photographs of Bethnal Green, p.5). Dubuffet’s Large Black Landscape 1946 (T07109), for example, evokes the rawness of urban textures. Untitled No. 8 (Shattered Glass) is similarly hard edged, but, unlike the Bethnal Green photographs, suggests violent destruction rather than simply rawness or decay.\nFurther reading:\nNigel Henderson: Recent Work, exhibition catalogue, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, 1961.\nNigel Henderson: Photographs of Bethnal Green 1949-1952, exhibition catalogue, Midland Group, Nottingham, 1978.\nVictoria Walsh, Nigel Henderson: Parallel of Life and Art, London 2001.\nAlice Sanger\nDecember 2008"

The Surrealists' game involves a piece of paper, folded horizontally concertina-fashion onto which, in turn, each member of a group draws a part of a body, without being able to see what others have drawn on the paper. The final result is a body or character of composite parts. The Chapman brothers have collaborated artistically since the early 1990s and decided to use the game to emphasise the dual nature of their work together, exploring difference within a unit. In this case they drew onto etching plates instead of pieces of paper. Each brother created ten head sections and had them covered by an assistant before exchanging plates and proceeding with the torso sections. The plates were again covered and exchanged for the remaining sections, ensuring that all four parts of the etchings were randomly matched. On some images the quarterly divisions are clearly visible and the background shaded in a horizontal segment; on others the different parts are less distinct. The artists have used a range of different drawing styles making it hard for the viewer to identify any one section with any particular hand. A selection of tools and differing degrees of pressure on the plate have resulted in a variety of effects. One section has been created using tiny dots made with a delicate tool, many others are finely etched in intricate lines. Simpler cartoon figures contrast with convoluted, messy and highly textured areas. The project was completed in twenty days."

Disasters of War 1993 (Tate T07454) and Hell 2000 (Saatchi Collection, London) are composed of cut up and reconstituted bodies. The etchings feature imagery common to the Chapmans' work in other media: skulls, eyeballs on stalks, grotesque animal heads, liquids dripping and spurting from wounds, orifices, nipples and shower-heads, writhing intestines, claw-like hands and feet. Around the edges of the figures tiny spiders hang from threads and flies crawl. Insects' wings and branching roots appear in the place of limbs. The images recreate the worlds of such artists as Hieronymous Bosch (1450-1516) and Goya (Fransisco de Goya y Lucientes, 1746-1819) with a contemporary feel. The Chapmans have referred to their work as having an 'infantile dialectic' (quoted in fig-1: 50 projects, 50 weeks), expressed through their exaggerated, comic-horror aesthetic."

The Roman poet Ovid (1st century BC) described chaos as ‘a rude and undeveloped mass...all discordant elements confused, were there congested in a shapeless heap’. In 1850 Watts planned a series of murals representing ‘the progress of the cosmos’. Here he charts a path of evolution. Primeval confusion is represented by giants struggling to release themselves from fire and vapour. The establishment of measurable time and space is signalled by the chain of female figures to the right."

     "text": "Issei Sagawa 2014 is an oil painting on canvas. It is a portrait of a man wearing a large hat that is too big for his head and whose wide brim forms two large dark areas either side of his cheeks. The face is rendered with very loose brush strokes whose directions do not correspond to the posture of the body. Several colours, including greens, greys and pinks, mix across the face, picking up the dominant colours of the figure’s pink clothes and the green-grey background."

He was imprisoned for several years before being released and returning to Japan. Here Tuymans depicts Sagawa as a young man, before his later crime and notoriety. Prior to this painting Tuymans had painted Sagawa twice before (see, for example, Issei Sagawa 2012)."

     "text": "Issei Sagawa is one of several portraits by Tuymans based on images of people associated with acts of violence. His series Die Zeit 1988 included a painting of Reinhard Heydrich, the deputy chief of the SS in Nazi Germany, while Der Architekt 1997 (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Galerie Neue Meister, Dresden) was based on an image of the German architect Albert Speer, who served as a minister under Hitler. Whereas in Der Architekt white paint covers the subject’s face, in Issei Sagawa it is the vigorous and loose brushwork that effaces the murderer’s image. Issei Sagawa exemplifies Tuymans’s use of cropping to focus the viewer’s attention on the painted subject and the materiality of the work. He previously used this technique in works such as The Secretary of State 2005 (Museum of Modern Art, New York), a painting based on an image of Condoleezza Rice, who served as America’s Secretary of State under President George W. Bush."

     "text": "Untitled is a sculpture combining two pieces of furniture with poured cement. Salcedo removed the two doors and single drawer from an old-fashioned free-standing wooden wardrobe she had bought from an antique shop. She inserted an old wooden chair into the opening on one side, so that the seat is inside the body of the wardrobe and the back crosses the central partition on the outside, before sealing the three openings into the wardrobe with cement, poured onto a supporting metal armature bulked with styrofoam. Cement residue filling all the crevices in the wardrobe and chair emphasise the sculpture’s fused appearance and evokes the sealing of a tomb.\nThe forced union of disparate elements is a central feature of Salcedo’s sculptures of the late 1980s through the 1990s. Such works as Untitled, 1987 (T07836) and Unland: audible in the mouth, 1998 (T07523) merge structures that, the artist has commented, ‘don’t fit and appear to be like the mutated remains of an accident’ (quoted in Garcia-Anton). For Salcedo, the tension arising from the clash of materials expresses the emotional and psychological unease at the heart of her work, which is motivated by the traumatic effects of civil war on the Columbian people. The use of particular materials to express this was inspired by the work of German artist Joseph Beuys (1921-86), which Salcedo discovered while she was studying art at New York University in the early 1980s (MFA 1984). Beuys’s notion of ‘social sculpture’ – integrating political awareness with making – and his focus on materials to convey specific meanings were a significant influence on her practice. She has elaborated:"

    {
     "text": "The way that an artwork brings materials together is incredibly powerful. Sculpture is its materiality. I work with materials that are already charged with significance, with a meaning they have acquired in the practice of everyday life. Used materials are profoundly human; they all bespeak the presence of a human being ... The handling of materials in each piece is the result of a specific act, related to the event I am working on. It is an act of everyday life that gives shape to the piece. In some cases it is a hopeless act of mourning ... The processes go beyond me, beyond my very limited capacity, whether because one single person couldn’t possibly have made the work (Unland, 1995-8), or because of the brutality and massiveness of the act (untitled furniture sculptures, 1995-8) ... [In] the situation in which I live ... you can see advanced technology existing side by side with extreme forms of underdevelopment. Oppositions of this kind are part of my life ... reality is always disrupted, always severed ... it is not simply a mixture but a cruel juxtaposition of things striving violently to manifest themselves simultaneously ... The handmade element of the work marks not merely an absence of industrial values, but also a wholehearted rejection of rationalism. Paradoxically war is the maximum expression both of industrialism and of its destruction ... I’m interested in the notion of the artist as a thinker attuned to every change in society but at the same time producing art that is irreducible to psychological or sociological explanations."

     "text": "Untitled, 1998 is one of a large group of Untitled sculptures combining domestic wooden furniture with cement that Salcedo created during the 1990s. The first series was exhibited as a large group at the Carnegie International, 1995 in Pittsburgh before being dispersed. Tate’s work was part of an installation in Liverpool’s Anglican Cathedral during the first Liverpool Biennial in 1999. The sculptures, mainly comprising cupboards, chests, armoirs and wardrobes, alone or combined with chairs, bed frames, tables and other chests, resonate in a variety of ways. The level surfaces of the poured cement combined with more or less visible sections of steel armature have industrial associations allied with minimalist sculpture, which the blocking of space – either filling openings or creating actual blocks on and under chairs – enhances. These sculptures recall such works by British artist Rachel Whiteread (born 1963) as Untitled (Nine Tables), 1998 (T07984) and Untitled (Rooms), 2001 (T07938) in which empty space – the space under a table and the negative space of a room – appears solid. In contrast to the rough, heavy cement with its blank, impassive flat surfaces the wooden furniture in Salcedo’s work appears fragile and mortal. Made by craftsmen, by hand, the sculpture’s wardrobe and chair have a history of relationships with human bodies – those that made them and those for whom they were created. In relation to the cement, they stand in for bodies; although as their openings are closed they are bodies that can no longer function; they are sealed and silenced in a manner that powerfully evokes death and entombment. As well as uncomfortably fusing two or more pieces of furniture, Salcedo’s Untitled series often incorporates clothing into the layer of concrete filling the openings in the cupboards, drawers and cabinets suggesting even more poignantly the remains of people who are no longer alive.\nFurther reading:\nCarlos Basualdo, Nancy Princenthal and Andreas Huyssen, Doris Salcedo, London 2000, reproduced p.116 and pp.144-5 in colour.\nAnthony Bond, Trace: 1st Liverpool Biennial of International Contemporary Art, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery Liverpool, 1999, pp.130-3.\nKatya Garcia-Anton, ‘Silent Witness: Doris Salcedo at the Tate Gallery’, Art Newspaper, no.94, July-August 1999, p.21.\nElizabeth Manchester\nDecember 2007"

Rather than an empty space waiting to be filled with worldly belongings or childish fantasies, the wardrobe becomes hermetically sealed and inaccessible. The configuration of armoire and chair is akin to that of a Pietà, the traditional depiction of the Madonna holding the body of the dead Christ on her lap."

     "text": "Black Virtue is an oil painting made on three canvases that have been joined to form a long, horizontally orientated triptych. Each of the three parts of the triptych is a different width, resulting in an asymmetrical composition. The dominant colour in the painting is black, with further areas of red, green, blue, purple, brown, yellow and cream. In the two outer panels, the painted forms are largely abstract. The pictorial space of the panel on the left-hand side is articulated by floating fragments of black planes that open up the perspective into an organic, amorphous, cavernous space. In the narrower right-hand section there are fragmentary planes, some of which are laid next to one other, while others give the impression of partially overlapping on a flatter surface, without creating the impression of a deep perspectival pictorial space. In the central canvas, which is the widest, the painted forms are more linear and biomorphic than those that flank them. They are set against a black background and some of them take the shape of female sex organs."

In 1971 Matta stated that although he could not recall the exact significance of the painting’s title, it might ‘even refer to the so-called virtue in wartime of killing the enemy’ (quoted in Wilson 1975, p.16). The large areas of black in the painting may also allude to death (see Wilson 1975, p.16). Around the same period that he made Black Virtue, the artist worked on several other triptychs that the curator Ronald Alley has suggested were ‘based on the idea of introducing deliberate contradictions and opposing different elements, somewhat in the tradition of triptychs by Old Masters with a central panel and contrasting wings’ (Alley 1981, p.503). In a letter of 18 August 1971, the art dealer Pierre Matisse wrote that Matta made two other such triptychs the same year as Black Virtue was created: Prince of the Blood (Tragyptic) and Redness of Lead."

    {
     "text": "The artistic strategy of opposing different and even contradictory elements was inspired by the surrealist principles of automatism and free association. In order to achieve these effects, Matta made his paintings by covering over one part while he painted the next. In the period that he made Black Virtue, Matta was also working on an experimental project in ‘correspondence’ with the French poet Charles Duits. In this project, Matta would make a drawing and Duits would write a poem at eleven o’clock every morning, after which they would compare the results. Parts of the imagery of Black Virtue relate to a certain extent to some of these drawings."

     "text": "Matta joined the French surrealist group in 1937 under the encouragement of the movement’s founder André Breton. He became acquainted with key surrealist artists and published articles and illustrations in Surrealist journals such as Minotaure. Art critic and curator Simon Wilson mentions that in this painting Matta ‘was concerned with capturing the inner world of the mind’, claiming that ‘Black Virtue evokes a fluid mental landscape in an extreme combination of eroticism and violence’ (Wilson 1975, p.16)."

     "text": "The Director of the Tate, Norman Reid reported the Trustees’ response to the artist in October 1966. He wrote: ‘You had twice mentioned to me that you would like to have the chance of painting the carpet in our picture “Study for a Portrait on Folding Bed” and that you regretted having to let it go in its present state.’ As a precautionary measure the ‘very sympathetic’ Trustees suggested that he and Bacon discussed the changes as they worried that ‘you might be tempted to go on and make other changes and that they would finish up with a completely different picture’.[6] It is not clear whether such a meeting took place but Bacon would claim in 1974 that ‘they [the Tate] refused’ his request to ‘take it back to lay down a carpet’.[7] The consistent reference to a carpet suggests that he wanted to cover the ground plane with a mottled patterning, such as that found in Lying Figure with Hypodermic Syringe, 1963 (private collection),[8] rather than the more defined rug of Seated Figure, 1961 (Tate Gallery T00459). In the event, no changes were made to the painting."

    {
     "text": "The issue as a whole allows a glimpse of the pressures of Bacon’s reputation. On the one hand, the fears of the Tate Trustees may have been founded on the artist’s known tendency to destroy canvases in the process of reworking. As David Sylvester suggested to the artist in 1962: ‘If people didn’t come and take them away from you, I take it, nothing would ever leave the studio; you’d go on till you’d destroyed them all.’[9] This perceived attitude, which was comparable to that of Giacometti, allowed artistic uncertainty to be equated with a broader existential struggle. On the other hand, Bacon’s claim that a detail had been foreseen is given credence by evidence that he planned his work more carefully than hitherto suspected: preparing lists of subjects (such as recently acquired by the Tate)[10] and allotting definite periods for working on given canvases.[11] The demands of his dealer, which were implicitly at the root of the discussion, appear to have upset this system and resulted in Study for Portrait on Folding Bed being hurried from the studio before completion. Bacon considered it a failure. He regretted, in particular, the oval with mechanical details in the foreground, commenting many years later ‘I wish they would burn it’.[12]"
    },
    {
     "text": "When Study for Portrait on Folding Bed was first shown in 1963, one critic could write flamboyantly: ‘the humanity of us all is flayed to the naked flesh of this amorphous figure demonaic on the bloody striped mattress.’[13] It was, by this time, commonplace to consider Bacon’s painting as as concerned with violence and this particular assessment conflates an interpretation of the body’s image with its painterly treatment, or, as Ronald Alley has commented, combined ‘the expressive violence of his distortions and his handling of paint’.[14] Both views may be suggested by the heavily worked and blackened area at the centre of the body and the vertical drips falling from it. These suggest the chance elements which Bacon claimed for his painting in his interviews with Sylvester.[15]"
    },
    {
     "text": "The setting is quite broadly painted around the central figure. The raw (reverse) side of the primed canvas provides the colour for the ground plane. The main forms appear to have been sketched first in black, which was used for the upper framework identified by Melville ‘as a transparent box’,[16] as well as in the green paint visible in the supports of the spiralling white railing. The figure and bed were completed before the flat painting of the encircling brown wall and the thicker red-brown curve at the bottom which is laid over yellow; both areas allowed some of the working splashes to be disguised. Had the proposed carpet been added these drips, and an apparently accidental stain which undulates down from the left half of the bed, could have been covered. A small oval enclosure of forms in the lower foreground echoes the energy and colouring of the figure; its is difficult to identify, apparently including a mechanism comparable to a gramophone or to the turning handle of studio easels."
    },
    {
     "text": "In his dismissal of the painting Bacon allowed only that the ‘layout was rather good’.[17] This concession is significant in the light of James Nixon’s observation, in his geometrical analysis of Bacon’s work,[18] that ‘the linear composition is very similar to that in Study for Crouching Nude, 1952’ (Detroit Institute of Arts).[19] The space-frame, the curvatures defining the walls and floor, and the spiralling railing are all close enough to suggest a deliberate quotation. This appears to be a pragmatic re-use of what he considered to be an especially successful composition. Indeed, there are other instances of this practice: in 1959, he envisaged a painting - which may have emerged as Two Figures in a Room, 1959 (R.J. Sainsbury)[20] - consisting of a ‘man crawling on rail as in detroit [sic] picture against rock background’;[21] in 1966, he mentioned that he was using the same painting as a starting point for a new - and coincidentally failed - composition.[22]"
    },
    {
     "text": "Bacon is said to have claimed that the folding bed ‘was suggested by a photo reproduced in a Museum of Modern Art publication’.[23] Although no such source has been identified, his listing of potential subjects in 1959 included: ‘The bed of crime in centre of circular room | with carpet - non-patterned carpet’.[24] This may reflect the artist’s ideas of the cathartic effect of violent drama brought into the everyday.[25] Certainly the temporary nature and unmade state of the bed in the Tate’s painting establish it as a site of display and of squalor. In this connection, David Mellor has drawn attention to Keith Vaughan’s homoerotic barrack-room drawings as well as the concentration on prostitutes on beds in Sickert’s Camden Town paintings.[26] Noting the significance of the fact that Bacon at one time owned one of the latter,[27] David Mellor has observed that ‘it was the intimate, private body that was represented by Sickert, secreted and secreting - where gross, abject matter was well to the fore’.[28] Bacon’s displayed bodies, and especially those on beds, may be read as part of a shared iconography - in which the bed was the site of sex and crime - dismantling the ‘tradition of decorous public portraiture’.[29]"
    },
    {
     "text": "The character of Bacon’s beds has a certain continuity. The flat blue of the furniture was used in other paintings made at the same time,[30] while the blue-striped ticking of the mattress was a recurrent detail over a rather longer period. Two particular instances reinforce the reading of violence associated with the mattress: the contemporary Lying Figure with Hypodermic Syringe, 1963 (private collection)[31] and the central panel of Three Studies for a Crucifixion, 1962 (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York).[32] Bacon did not comment specifically upon the reclining figure in the triptych - being more concerned with the carcass of the right panel[33] - but he would later refer to the hypodermic ‘nailing the image more strongly into reality or appearance ... because I wanted a nailing of the flesh onto the bed’.[34] In both of these paintings the figure appears to be a female nude, whereas in Study for Portrait on Folding Bed it is apparently male and at least partially clothed: the rolled sleeves of the pinkened white shirt are bunched at the elbow. This distinction opens up possibilities for reading the figure in Bacon’s work, as Ernst van Alphen has suggested, whether it is the female as the ‘embodiment of sexual desire’[35] or the fragmentation of the male body as a ‘loss of self’.[36] Bacon’s identification of his mode of painting as an act of injury to the sitter[37] also suggests the anonymous body as ‘the object of action instead of its subject’ (in van Alphen’s formulation).[38]"
    },
    {
     "text": "The figure in Study for Portrait on Folding Bed demonstrates the way in which the density of paint was used in re-making the material quality of the body. The paint is bulked out with sand,[39] and this adds weight and texture in contrast to the smooth uniformity of the surroundings. Other techniques are in evidence. The whole area is speckled with fine black points of paint; these seem to have been relatively dry when flicked on, as they left a residue when dragged across the area of the elbow. The spots are associated with the more energetic area of black below, which is the origin of the long drips towards the base. This explosion is centred on the groin of the sitter, and may have concomitant sexual associations. Sweeps with the brush have described the positions of the legs (the sitter’s left foot is tucked under the right knee, and the right foot extended outwards) and then obscured them. They run across several white circles in the area of the legs and smaller green ones marking the toes; these appear to be made by off-printing from objects - perhaps a cork in the latter case. The energy of this paintwork is also present in the making of the shirt - pink over white with red at the collar - and especially the head. Here a variety of colours and forms combine to construct the features: red and yellow (comparable to the colouring of the base of the painting) appear in the hair and are set against lilac and purple in the ears. All combine in the face which is also overlaid with white in the forehead and the blackening of the eyes (which encouraged the description of ‘demonaic’); the bridge of the nose is marked with a spot of white squeezed straight from the tube. Although limited in area, this use of materials may be compared to the loading of paint by Bacon’s contemporaries both in Britain (such as Frank Auerbach) and in France (Giacometti, Dubuffet)."
    },
    {
     "text": "The mastering of the involuntary mark-making by ‘nailing the image ... into reality’ was essential to Bacon’s development of what has been termed by Gilles Deleuze (following J-F. Lyotard) a ‘figural’ art, in order to distinguish it from both ‘figurative’ illusion and abstraction.[40] The artist suggested to Sylvester in 1966 that adjustments to the features might become apparent in the process of painting through ‘a sort of graph’ of marks, and stated his desire ‘to be able in a portrait to make a Sahara of the appearance - to make it so like, yet seeming to have the distance of the Sahara’.[41] Extrapolating from this, Dawn Ades has commented on the ‘non-rational’ marks with which Bacon was able to ‘re-make a likeness’, so that ‘distortion, fragmentation, isolation ... are on one level the result of a pictorial battle against illustrative figuration’.[42] Like the artist himself, Deleuze has placed particular emphasis on the isolation of the individual in the paintings through the device of the rail set against and dividing it from the uniform background.[43] Although more concerned with the depiction of body as flesh than the transformation of the individual, Deleuze’s phenomenological approach allows a reading of the moving figure which ‘n’est pas seulement le corps isolé, mais le corps déformé qui s’échappe’ (is not only the isolated body, but the deformed body which escapes itself).[44] As such the painter’s practice bears comparison to the perception of the body and notions of the hysterical in the writings of his contemporaries, such as Artaud, Burroughs and Beckett.[45] In the particular case of Study for Portrait on Folding Bed such observations allow the spiralling rail to be seen as a zoning device and as a domestic furnishing which highlights the conceptual isolation and strangeness of the individual."

     "text": "Unland: audible in the mouth is one of a group of three sculptures collectively titled Unland that Salcedo created in 1995-8. The works are a response to the testimonies of children who witnessed their parents’ murder during Colombia’s civil war. As part of the process of creating the Unland works, the artist travelled to a northern region of the country to research the experiences of these orphans and the ways their lives developed as a result of their trauma. Unland: the orphan’s tunic, 1997 (Funcació ‘la Caixa’ Barcelona), Unland: irreversible witness, 1995-8 (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) and Unland: audible in the mouth (the last and most minimal of the series) were all made by fusing two old wooden tables into one. Salcedo bought the pine and oak tables she used to make Unland: audible in the mouth in Bogotá, where she lives and works. The two tables have been joined by sawing off the legs at one end of each table and fitting the legless ends together. The artist and her assistants drilled thousands of tiny holes into the tables’ surfaces before a team of volunteers laboriously threaded a combination of human hair and split silk fibres through the holes to cover much of the wood. The ‘stitching’ crosses the hybrid table against the length of the grain, and varies in density and colour. Salcedo used black and dark brown Colombian women’s hair she sourced from a local hairdresser and raw white silk. The silk threads are most dense at the end of the pine table, where they also encircle the legs and cover the sides; the ratio of silk to hair gradually decreases towards the central join where hair then supersedes silk on the wider oak table. Deep cuts scored lengthways into the table tops as part of the stitching process evoke controlled wounding, very different from the shallow grooves and notches scratched into the wood during its life as a table in a home. The surface of fine thread and hairs that cover much of the wooden surface recalls the veil of cobwebs that appears in abandoned places and on objects not touched for a long time.\nSalcedo studied art and art history at Bogotá University (BFA 1980) where she majored in painting and theatre and was particularly inspired by her teacher, the painter Beatriz Gonzalez (born 1938). She began making sculpture in New York in the early 1980s, while attending New York University (MA 1984). Here she encountered the work of Joseph Beuys (1921-86), whose notion of ‘social sculpture’ – integrating political awareness with making – and his focus on materials to convey specific meanings were a significant influence on her. She began to think of sculpture as ‘a crossroad, a meeting point’ (quoted in Basualdo, p.11), of ideology, theory, materials and objects. In New York, Saldedo also experienced being a displaced outsider – a sense she retained on her return to Bogotá in 1985, where she deliberately maintained her peripheral position in order to have a critical distance on Colombian society.\nSince the mid 1980s, Salcedo has based her work on the experiences of Colombian people whose lives have been damaged by the country’s civil war. During the 1990s, the artist interviewed the relatives of dead and missing people and did extensive research into the records of humanitarian workers. From these stories she created sculptures that poetically resonate with the affects of loss and horror resulting from the trauma of extreme violence. Salcedo invented the title Unland to express the conditions of dispossession and displacement created by war. In Colombia most of those suffering these conditions are in the most distant rural areas of the country and have no voice and no presence to make their suffering known. The word ‘un-land’ suggests a reversal of some kind – a place that is no longer a place, a country that no longer exists. ‘Un-land’ evokes the impossibility to imagine or to express the trauma suffered by children who see their parents die violently and whose lives are irrevocably damaged by this experience. The phrase ‘audible in the mouth’ is derived from a poem by the German-speaking Jewish Romanian poet Paul Celan (1920-70), whose writing was driven by the Holocaust in which his parents perished. To express horrors for which there were no words, Celan invented hybrid and fragmented words or forms of language, ultimately inspiring Salcedo to do the same. The phrase ‘audible in the mouth’, taken from Celan’s poem An Eye, Open, first published in a collection entitled Sprachgitter or Language Mesh (1959), evokes words that cannot be taken into the body in the normal way – through the ears – but rather through the rather more visceral channel of the mouth. The ‘audible’ words, like the victims and their stories, are displaced to a place where a different kind of hearing occurs – a non-verbal gut-impacting expression of permanent emotional damage to which Salcedo’s Unland sculptures attempt to give visible form. They transform the neutral association of tables – around which a family might sit to share a meal – to the disturbing notion of a prop on which a body might be fixed to be tortured or a dead body might be cut open. The intense and pointless labour of stitching wood with hair and silk suggests an attempt to repair the irreparable affective damage of war.\nFurther reading:\nTanya Barson, ‘”Unland” The Place of Testimony, Doris Salcedo’s Unland: audible in the mouth 1998’, Contemporary Art in Focus, Patrons’ Paper 3, January 2004, London, http://www.tate.org.uk/research/tateresearch/tatepapers/04spring/unland_paper.htm.\nCarlos Basualdo, Nancy Princenthal and Andreas Huyssen, Doris Salcedo, London 2000, pp.21, 25, reproduced pp.135, 136 and 138-9 in colour.\nUnland: Doris Salcedo: New Work, exhibition brochure, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 1999, reproduced [p.4].\nElizabeth Manchester\nDecember 2007"

These are scanned and printed renditions of the front and back of journalistic photos of car engines found scattered around the city of Beirut following bomb explosions during the war. The artist found the photos in the Lebanese press, such as the daily newspapers Annahar and As-Safir. The date of the explosion, the name of the photographer when known, and an English translation of the notes found at the back of the pictures are included at the bottom of each print. On the right hand edge of each of the prints, running vertically, is the name of the artist, the Atlas Group file that the work belongs to, the title of the file, and the date of production of the work. These framed prints, which the artist terms ‘dossiers’, are shown arranged in a rectangular grid on the wall. The work was produced in an edition of five, of which Tate owns the fourth.

The force of explosion causes the engine to soar tens and sometimes hundreds of meters away from the site where the bomb was detonated. As a result of this, car engines were found all around the city of Beirut, in such locations as balconies, roofs and nearby streets. Photographs of these engines were a common feature in newspaper reports at the time of the war. The repetitive presentation of these pictures can be seen as a comment on the banality of violence during war. Raad also explores the relationship between the details of the cars and the bombs used to explode them. The work may be understood as operating between research, archiving and ironic interpretation of a historic reality. Furthermore, it can be said to examine issues such as authorship, authority and authenticity, as well as the ways in which the history of Lebanon is documented and remembered."

     "text": "examines multiple dimensions of the wars – social, political, economic, military, technological, psychological and epistemic – as expressed in what is believed and articulated with regards to the 245 car bombs that were detonated in Lebanon during this period. The project is not an attempt to place blame or generalize suffering. Not all of the Lebanese people sustained physical or psychological harm from car bomb explosions, nor did all militias and armies use car bombs to terrorize, destroy, or kill. What our work demonstrates is that the detonation of a car bomb is not only an act of violence, but also produces a discourse that directly and indirectly affects individuals, families, and communities. We have found that the car bomb is both a cause and a consequence of the ongoing political, military, economic, and criminal conflicts that have defined most aspects of life in Lebanon for the past thirty years. The history of these car bomb explosions doubles as a history of how the wars were physically and psychically experienced, and how those who lived through such events speak about and assimilate their experiences."

This work assembles one hundred images, showing the aftermath of car bombs in Beirut during the Lebanese civil war (1975-1990). Arranged in a claustrophobic grid, they convey the numbing repetition and banality of violence in wartime. The photographs are authentic photojournalistic images. However, the way they are presented challenges the notions of historical veracity and the reliability\nof personal and collective memory."

     "text": "Ghost Story 2007 is a fifteen-minute single channel colour video projection with a voiceover that centres on a journey around Derry in Northern Ireland. The main location depicted in the video is a long empty pathway – flanked by woods on either side and a barbed-wire fence on the right – down which the camera slowly travels. At other times the camera moves through a derelict area with lock-up garages, a dark urban underpass and a patch of open wasteland on which a silver car is parked with a man sitting inside it. Interspersed with the footage of these landscapes, which are mostly seen in a murky blue-grey twilight with some brief night-time sequences, are occasional close-ups of eyes (both male and female) that gaze past the camera. Written by the creator of Ghost Story, the Northern Irish artist Willie Doherty, and delivered by the actor Stephen Rea in a dispassionate manner filled with long pauses, the voiceover details personal memories, often concerning murder and violence, that seem to be connected with the landscapes depicted in the video (text reproduced in Fruitmarket Gallery 2009, unpaginated). For instance, the narrator suggests that the trees contain ‘shadow-like figures’ whose terrified faces remind him of a crowd of people he once saw fleeing for safety. This video is shown on a loop in a dark, enclosed space, projected directly onto and completely filling a white wall that is between four and six metres wide, with two speakers playing the voiceover. Tate’s copy of Ghost Story is the artist’s proof, which was produced alongside an edition of three."

    {
     "text": "The footage for Ghost Story was shot with a high definition digital camera in Derry – where Doherty was born in 1959 and where he continues to live and work – in December 2006, and its main location is a disused railway line that has been converted into a footpath. The work was edited by Doherty in a studio in Belfast in April 2007."
    },
    {
     "text": "As the title Ghost Story implies, Doherty’s video explores the idea of the past haunting the present. Both the movements of the camera, which may reflect the narrator’s perspective but which are so steady that they do not appear attached to a human body, and the words of the voiceover, which refer to ‘restless creatures whose intentions are often beyond our comprehension’ and figures who ‘inhabit a world somewhere between here and the next’, create a strong sense that spectral forces are at work in the video. The evocation of ghosts in the work can be related to the history of Northern Ireland, especially the violence associated with the Troubles, a period of political conflict that began in the late 1960s and is widely considered to have concluded in the late 1990s. Ghost Story suggests that the landscapes in the video may have once functioned as a stage for traumatic acts, even if little physical evidence of suffering is visible. As the curator Fiona Bradley has written, ‘There is a sense in the film that it is the ground as much as the man who is walking on it that remembers the bloodshed’ (Fiona Bradley, ‘Uncommon Ground’, in Fruitmarket Gallery 2009, p.6)."
    },
    {
     "text": "In exploring the legacy of the Troubles, Ghost Story can be compared with works such as Paul Graham’s photographic series Troubled Land 1984–6 (see Tate P79338–P79343), which depicts urban and rural landscapes subtly but discernibly shaped by the conflict. Doherty’s use of lengthy tracking shots in his video may also be aligned with the techniques employed by the British director Alan Clarke in Elephant (1989), a film that explores the violence of the Troubles through uninterrupted takes that culminate in brutal and unexplained murders."
    },
    {
     "text": "Although Doherty studied sculpture at Ulster Polytechnic in 1978–81, much of his work in the early 1980s consisted of black and white photographs overlaid with text. His first video work, The Only Good One is a Dead One 1993, is a two-screen installation focusing on a car journey that includes a voiceover relating the speaker’s thoughts, fears and fantasies about violence. In 2007, discussing his frequent use of spoken and written texts in his work, Doherty explained:"
